A unique collaborative effort between the two platforms enables us to examine whether C2C sellers are motivated to engage in marketing activities on a separate social media platform. Applying machine learning methods, we first classify whether C2C sellers conduct social media marketing on their microblogs or not, which allows the measurement of social media marketing activeness. We then use logistic regression models and find that earned reputational assets such as the rating scores and the number of followers are significantly associated with social media marketing activeness on both platforms. However, we identify a conflict of owned reputational assets such as the shop age and the paid membership between the two platforms, which provides a potential explanation for the limited success of the cross-platform collaboration. © 2023 The Author(s)","China; Electronic commerce; Reputational assets; Social media marketing","Learning systems; Marketing; Social networking (online); China; Digital platforms; Machine learning methods; Marketing activities; Micro-blogging platforms; Online shopping; Reputational asset; Sina-weibo; Social media marketings; Social media platforms; Electronic commerce","","","","","","","Abed S.S., Social commerce adoption using TOE framework: An empirical investigation of Saudi Arabian SMEs, Int.

Why are some firms such outstanding performers in market orientation (MO)? This study identifies three categories of new technology tools that have emerged in the past few years—big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and social media marketing research—and assesses how each category enhances MO. The empirical evidence from 442 firms indicates that all three categories have significant impacts on MO, with AI being the most effective, followed by big data analytics and social media marketing research, respectively. We outline how very successful firms adopt these new technology tools and offer managerial implications that can guide senior executives looking to increase MO. © Copyright © 2022, Innovation Research Interchange.","Artificial Intelligence; Big data analytics; Market orientation; Market-oriented firms; Social media marketing research","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Commerce; Data Analytics; Social networking (online); Managerial implications; Market orientation; Market-oriented firm; Marketing research; Social media marketings; Social medium marketing research; Three categories; Marketing","","","","","","","DeVellis R.F., Scale Development: Theory and Applications, (2017); Dillman D.A., Smyth J.D., Christian L.M., Internet, Phone, Mail, and Mixed Mode Surveys: The Tailored Design Method, (2014); Frosen J., Luoma J., Jaakkola M., Tikkanen H., Aspara J., What counts versus what can be counted: the complex interplay of market orientation and marketing performance measurement, Journal of Marketing, 80, 3, pp. 60-78, (2016); Gupta V.K., Atav G., Dutta D.K., Market orientation research: a qualitative synthesis and future research agenda, Review of Managerial Science, 13, 4, pp. 649-670, (2017); Hu C., Song M., Guo F., Intellectual structure of market orientation: a citation/co-citation analysis, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 37, 6, pp. 598-616, (2019); Jaworski B.J., Kohli A.K., Market orientation: antecedents and consequences, Journal of Marketing, 57, 3, pp. 53-70, (1993); Kohli A.K., Jaworski B.J., Market orientation: the construct, research propositions, and managerial implications, Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 1-18, (1990); Kohli A.K., Jaworski B.J., Kumar A., MARKOR: a measure of market orientation, Journal of Marketing Research, 30, 4, pp. 467-477, (1993); Mikalef P., Pappas I.O., Krogstie J., Giannakos M., Big data analytics capabilities: A systematic literature review and research agenda, Information Systems and e-Business Management, 16, pp. 547-578, (2018); Moorman C., Day G.S., Organizing for marketing excellence, Journal of Marketing, 80, 6, pp. 6-35, (2016); Song M., Parry M.E., The desired level of market orientation and business unit performance, Journal of Academy of Marketing Science, 37, 2, pp. 144-160, (2009); Varadarajan R., Research on market orientation: Some lessons shared and issues discussed in a doctoral seminar, Academy of Marketing Science Review, 7, 1-2, pp. 26-35, (2017); Wang Y., Zhang H., Song M., Pure or ambidextrous strategy?

Methodology: The data from 386 Indian social media users was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and stimulus–organism–response (SOR) frameworks. Findings: The study found that SMMA significantly influenced cognitive and affective aspects of engagement. Affective engagement (AE) positively affected both e-WOM and ORPI. Perceived risk (PR) considerably moderated the relationships between SMMA and cognitive engagement (COG). It also moderated the relation of COG and AE with ORPI, while PR did not moderate the relationship of SMMA& AE or AE & e-WOM or COG & e-WOM. Implications: This current study discussed how various forms of engagement affected specific purchase behaviors like e-WOM and ORPI. We also underlined the role of PR in forming COG and AE to drive those behaviors. By scrutinizing these relationships between the SOR and ELM frameworks, the study significantly contributed to the existing knowledge. Originality: This study offered valuable insights for e-commerce businesses to design effective SMM strategies and manage CE, especially in the presence of PR. It also outlined whether companies should adopt the central or peripheral route of the ELM when designing such strategies. © 2025, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

To optimize conversion rates, the landing pages must effectively respond to a visitor segment’s pain points that they need solutions for. A one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate since even if the product meets the needs of all consumers, their priorities may diverge. In this study, we propose a pipeline for creating personalized landing pages that dynamically cater to visiting customers’ specific concerns. As a use case, a pipeline will be utilized to create a personalized pharmacy discount card landing page, serving for the particular needs of chronic diabetic users seeking to purchase needed medications at a reduced cost. The proposed pipeline incorporates additional stages to augment the traditional online marketing funnel, including acquisition of salient tweets, filtration of irrelevant ones, extracting themes from relevant tweets, and generating coherent paragraphs. To collect relevant tweets and reduce bias, Facebook groups and pages relevant to individuals with diabetes are leveraged. Pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and sentence transformers are used to cluster the tweets based on their similarities. GuidedLDA exhibits superior performance in identifying customer priorities. Human evaluations reveal that personalized landing pages are more effective in getting attention and building attraction by addressing their concerns and engaging the audiences. The proposed methodology offers a practical architecture for developing customized landing pages considering visiting customers’ profiles and needs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Customer engagement; Landing page optimization; Personalization; Social media marketing; Twitter","Electronic commerce; Landing; Sales; Social networking (online); Customer engagement; Landing page optimization; Landing pages; Online marketing; Optimisations; Personalizations; Social media; Social media marketings; Targeted marketing; Twitter; Pipelines","","","","","","","Ash T., Landing page optimization: the definitive guide to testing and tuning for conversions, (2011); Barzilay R., Elhadad N., Inferring strategies for sentence ordering in multidocument news summarization, J Artif Intell Res, 17, pp. 35-55, (2002); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation, J Mach Learn Res, 3, Jan, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bollegala D., Okazaki N., Ishizuka M., A bottom-up approach to sentence ordering for multi-document summarization, Inf Process Manag, 46, 1, pp. 89-109, (2010); Brown T., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J.D., Dhariwal P., Et al., Language models are few-shot learners, Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Cahill T.J., Wertz B., Zhong Q., Parlato A., Donegan J., Forman R., Et al., The search for consumers of web-based raw dna interpretation services: using social media to target hard-to-reach populations, J Med Internet Res, 21, 7, (2019); Campos R., Mangaravite V., Pasquali A., Jorge A., Nunes C., Jatowt A., Yake!

The approach takes an image and text prompt as input and aims to edit the image in accordance with the text prompt while preserving text-unrelated regions. The results of text-guided image editing differ depending on the way the text prompt is represented, even if it has the same meaning. It is up to the user to decide which result best matches the intended use of the edited image. This paper assumes a situation in which edited images are posted to social media and proposes a novel text-guided image editing method to help the edited images gain attention from a greater audience. In the proposed method, we apply the pre-trained text-guided image editing method and obtain multiple edited images from the multiple text prompts generated from a large language model. The proposed method leverages the novel model that predicts post scores representing engagement rates and selects one image that will gain the most attention from the audience on social media among these edited images. Subject experiments on a dataset of real Instagram posts demonstrate that the edited images of the proposed method accurately reflect the content of the text prompts and provide a positive impression to the audience on social media compared to those of previous text-guided image editing methods. © 2024 by the authors.","diffusion model; post score; posted image editing; social media marketing; text-guided image editing","Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Diffusion model; Guided images; Image editing; Natural languages; Post score; Posted image editing; Social media; Social media marketings; Text-guided image editing; Marketing","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (JP23K11141, JP21H03456, JP23K11211, 23K21676)","This study was partly supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP21H03456, JP23K11141, and JP23K11211.","Number of Instagram Users Worldwide from 2020 to 2025, (2023); Number of Social Media Users Worldwide from 2017 to 2027, (2023); Center P.R., Photos and Videos as Social Currency Online, (2012); Wu X., Xu K., Hall P., A survey of image synthesis and editing with generative adversarial networks, Tsinghua Sci.

Design/methodology/approach: Using structural equation modeling, 613 tourists from different nationalities were used to test the five hypotheses. Findings: The research results revealed that second-order destinations' extrinsic motivations directly impact TIM and PDI. It also showed that tourists' experiences as moderators reduce the direct effect of DEM on PDI for first-time visitors compared to repeat visitors. Moreover, it increases the direct effect of TIM on PDI for repeated visitors. Practical implications: Destination managers can fix the problems that hurt their reputations and images by hiring police officers in tourist areas and cleaning tourist places. In the same way, destination managers and travel agencies should use AI tools to create social media marketing campaigns focusing on natural and historical monuments. Also, the marketing plans should stress the value for money (for example, lodging, food and attractions’ cost). Finally, destination marketers can make programs for repeat visitors, focusing on DEM and TIM. Originality/value: This article tries to fill a gap in the research on PDI formation in emerging markets as a modern technique in destination marketing by using the push-intrinsic and pull-extrinsic theories. It also looks at how the tourists' experiences moderate the direct link between DEM, TIM and PDI. Lastly, this study examines how TIM affects a destination's image in emerging markets. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Destination's extrinsic motivations; Emerging markets; Perceived destination image; Tourists' experiences; Tourists' intrinsic motives","Law enforcement; Marketing; Motivation; Design/methodology/approach; Destination extrinsic motivation; Destination image; Emerging markets; Extrinsic motivation; Perceived destination image; Tourist destinations; Tourist' experience; Tourist' intrinsic motive; Visitor experiences; Commerce","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Karahanna E., Time flies when you’re having fun: cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage, MIS Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 665-694, (2000); Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., Trustworthiness in MHealth information services: an assessment of a hierarchical model with mediating and moderating effects using partial least squares (PLS), Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62, 1, pp. 100-116, (2011); Alcazar M.D.C.H., Pinero M.S., de Maya S.R., The effect of user-generated content on tourist behavior: the mediating role of destination image, Tourism and Management Studies, 10, pp. 158-164, (2014); Almeida-Garcia F., Domigunez-Azcue J., Mercade-Mele P., Perez-Tapia G., Can a destination really change its image?

It addresses a research gap concerning the effects of post length on various emotional aspects and engagement metrics within social media marketing. Data were collected from January 1, 2024, to January 30, 2024, covering posts from January 2013 to December 2023 on official Facebook pages of several sports shoe brands. After cleaning an initial 723 posts, 636 were analyzed using statistical methods and Python libraries. Eight emotional aspects—fear, anger, sadness, trust, anticipation, joy, disgust, and surprise—were examined in relation to post length. Mean reaction values and emotional aspects were compared before and during the COVID-19 period. A structured equation model (SEM) in AMOS assessed these relationships. The analysis revealed that longer posts positively influenced trust (β = 0.208, ρ < 0.001), anticipation (β = 0.095, ρ < 0.05), joy (β = 0.259, ρ < 0.001), and surprise (β = 0.072, ρ < 0.05), but did not significantly affect fear (β = 0.065, ρ = 0.089), sadness (β = 0.054, ρ = 0.155), or disgust (β = 0.072, ρ = 0.116). During COVID-19, increased trust and anticipation were noted, while sadness and anger decreased. This study highlights that longer Facebook posts can enhance engagement through increased trust, anticipation, joy, and surprise, offering valuable insights for optimizing social media content strategies. © 2024 The Authors","COVID-19; Emotional dynamics; Facebook posts; Machine learning; Sports shoe brands","","","","","","","","Shaikh A.R., Alhoori H., Sun M., YouTube and science: models for research impact, Scientometrics, 128, pp. 933-955, (2023); Chawla Y., Chodak G., Social media marketing for businesses: organic promotions of web-links on Facebook, J.

It encompasses brand identity, organisational culture, values, and reputation, and is key in building relationships with stakeholders. An ethical corporate identity, in particular the perception of a company as ethical and socially responsible, positively influences employee behaviour and engagement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised business management and offers innovative solutions to improve decision-making, efficiency, and transparency. Integrating AI into corporate governance can improve risk management, compliance, and accountability. In the digital age, social media are key in building and maintaining the brand voice of businesses. With the advent of AI, new tools such as Chat GPT have emerged to simplify and accelerate content creation, including social media posts. However, achieving satisfactory brand-voice results using AI requires careful analysis and extensive, representative data that travels into the prompter. Although AI-generated content is fast, it should be vetted by experienced experts to ensure it aligns with brand values and brand image. Although Chat GPT promises to generate content and brand-voice, its successful use requires collaboration with experienced experts and thoughtful consideration of its use in building and maintaining an authentic and effective brand-voice. © (2024), (University of SS.

The survey was conducted in-person among customers (528 participants) at various Colombian banks over a period of seven months, from May 2021 to November 2021. The responses on the survey were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”. The study also incorporated a focus group with 25 participants aged between 34 and 51. Moreover, the research employs factorial analysis to elucidate the underlying correlations between the variables. The discussion was structured around seven pre-determined variables: Personalization, Entertainment, Engagement, Marketing, Word of Mouth, Trust, and Loyalty. The load factors range between 0.583 and 0.914, implying a high correlation between the survey questions and the constructs. The Cronbach’s Alpha values (from 0.753 to 0.996) and the Composite Reliability values (from 0.739 to 0.875) suggest a high level of internal consistency within the constructs. In the realm of social media marketing, the research underscores the pivotal role of trust as an intermediary in cultivating brand loyalty. The study abstains from concentrating on hypothesis testing, instead it illuminates the criticality of understanding the role trust plays in social media marketing. The research results provide valuable insights for future investigations as well as for enhancing service marketing strategies in the banking sector. © Heidy Rico, Mario de la Puente, Juan Diego Rios Mahecha, Helen Perez, 2023.","Colombian banks; customer loyalty; retail banking; social media marketing; trust","","","","","","","","Ahmad N., Naveed R.

However, analyzing social media remains challenging due to the large volume of conversations generated on these platforms and the complexity of identifying stakeholder relationships. Automation, leveraging artificial intelligence and big data analysis, presents a promising solution, yet a comprehensive analysis framework is demanding. This study addresses this gap by introducing an automated process for analyzing social media conversations grounded in Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic and Stakeholder Theory. It examines social media marketing during the pandemic, focusing on adopting a LINE group as a marketing channel by SMEs in Taiwan. It uses the Beipu Farmers Association (BFA) as a case study. This study identifies the marketing strategies employed by the BFA and explores stakeholder relationship dynamics. Method: A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative techniques such as text mining, graph data analysis, and visualization, as well as qualitative methods like interviews in an explanatory sequential design. Results: The study yielded two key findings: first, the institutionalization of practices stemming from interactions between the BFA and customers within the LINE group; second, the visualization of stakeholder relationships, which helps BFA executives assess the effectiveness of their social media marketing strategies. Conclusion: This research introduces a process that applies automation to social media analysis, providing valuable insights for improving marketing strategies. It also underscores the dynamic nature of social media marketing strategies, enabling SMEs like the BFA to adapt and thrive amid operational disruptions, such as those caused by the pandemic. Moreover, this study’s novel analysis demonstrates a fresh perspective on measuring customer engagement via social media. © Association for Information Systems.","Graph Data Science; Institutionalization; Mixed-methods Approach; Service-Dominant Logic; Social Media Marketing Strategies","","","","","","","","Akaka M.

From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%. The results show that trends (Beta = 0.299) are the most decisive factors impacting brand awareness of TikTok users. Besides, electronic word of mouth (Beta = 0.242), influencer (Beta = 0.220), entertainment (Beta = 0.206), interaction (Beta = 0.200), and storytelling (Beta = 0.179) also positively affect the brand awareness of TikTok users. Limitations and further research suggest that marketers should investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the consumer’s brand awareness-constructing process. © Cuong Nguyen, Thao Tran, Tien Nguyen, 2024.","brand; e-WOM; entertainment; influencer; interactivity; marketing communications; storytelling; trends","","","","","","","","Aaker D., Aaker on branding: 20 principles that drive success, (2014); Agichtein E., Castillo C., Donato D., Gionis A., Mishne G., Finding high-quality content in social media, Proceedings of the 2008 international conference on web search and data mining, pp. 183-194, (2008); Anderson E.

With its versatile applications in content creation, customer interactions and social media marketing, GPT has redefined the way businesses engage with their audiences. This research paper focuses on the applications of GPT in social media marketing, search ads and display advertisements, enhancing customer support and interactions. By harnessing the conversational capabilities of ChatGPT, businesses are able to deliver personalised responses, address customer queries, and provide tailored recommendations, thereby elevating the overall customer experience and driving customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the ability of GPT to generate creative and engaging content has proven invaluable in the realm of social media marketing. Marketers can leverage GPT to automate the creation of social media posts, craft captivating captions, and generate relevant hashtags that resonate with their target audience. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, empirical studies and case examples, this paper demonstrates the transformative potential of GPT in digital marketing. It highlights the advantages and opportunities arising from integrating GPTbased technologies, emphasising the significance of personalised customer interactions and compelling social media content for achieving marketing objectives. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role and implications of GPT in digital marketing, offering valuable insights for practitioners and researchers in the field. © 2023, Henry Stewart Publications.

This model defines campaign success criteria for strategy. A statistical analysis approach was used to analyze the data for the research. Data was gathered through a survey. This study analyzes demographic parameters descriptively using the structural equation model (SEM). From comprehensive surveys, 125 digital media and 115 online shop subjects responded. Sampled were 240 people. According to the findings, social media data, customer journey research, successful advertising, and informed approaches are highly correlated. Compared to the previous study, website performance evaluation does not match the marketing plan's success. The model's results can be used by any company that communicates with clients online. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Artificial intelligence; Consumers; Key performance indicators; Mail; Media; Mobile marketing; Search engines; Social identification; Social media marketing","","","","","","","","Ajah I.

Through a quantitative research approach, data were collected from 385 social media users using a structured survey. The findings reveal that all four factors significantly influence purchase intentions, with influencer credibility demonstrating the strongest impact. These results highlight the importance of strategic social media marketing in shaping consumer behavior, emphasizing the need for targeted advertising, brand engagement, credible influencers, and trustworthy platforms.

Driven by the quest for innovative marketing strategies that resonate with family-oriented consumers, this study seeks to bridge this gap by applying machine learning to analyze visual content in the maternity and baby care product sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study incorporates a range of machine learning techniques – including open science framework feature detection, panoptic segmentation, customized instance segmentation, and face detection calculation methods – to analyze and predict the appeal of images, thereby enhancing user engagement and parent-child intimacy. Findings: The exploration of various ML models, such as DT, LightGBM, RIPPER algorithm, and CNNs, has offered a comparative analysis that addresses a methodological gap in the existing literature, which frequently depends on isolated model evaluations. According to our quadrant analysis with respect to engagement rate and parent-child intimacy, the selection of a model for real-world applications depends on balancing performance and interpretability. Originality/value: The proposed system offers a series of actionable recommendations designed to enhance customer engagement and foster brand loyalty. This study contributes to image design in maternity and baby care marketing and provides analytical insights for recommendation systems. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital marketing; Instagram; Machine learning; Maternity and baby care industry; Recommendation systems; Visual analysis","","","","","","","","Alencar P., Cowan D., The use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems: a systematic review, Expert Systems with Applications, 97, pp. 205-227, (2018); Altindis S.F., Dalva Y., Pehlivan H., Dundar A., Benchmarking the robustness of instance segmentation models, arXiv preprint, (2021); Aum J., Kim J., Park E., Can we predict the Billboard music chart winner?

Though it is spreading fast, the trend is still new and, therefore, limited research has been conducted on the topic. This study aims to investigate the impact of virtual influencers on customers and whether there is a direct impact on human influencers due to the rise of virtual influencers in the industry. The study employed a questionnaire-based survey method to collect and analyse responses from a sample of 357 participants. The questions focus on trust, credibility, expertise, and contribution to purchase intention by the virtual influencers. The results indicate that customers are increasingly attracted to virtual influencers and that virtual influences are perceived as more trustworthy, credible, and relevant to customers’ preferences, leading to an increase in purchase intention. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for managers designing marketing campaigns. © 2023 by the author.","artificial intelligence; consumer behaviour; consumer perception; influencer marketing; social media marketing; virtual influencers","","","","","","","","Alboqami H., Trust me, I’m an influencer!—Causal recipes for customer trust in artificial intelligence influencers in the retail industry, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 72, (2023); Amelina D., Zhu Y.-Q., Investigating effectiveness of source credibility elements on social commerce endorsement: The case of Instagram in Indonesia, PACIS 2016 Proceedings, pp. 232-241, (2016); Amos C., Holmes G., Strutton D., Exploring the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and advertising effectiveness: A quantitative synthesis of effect size, International Journal of Advertising, 27, pp. 209-234, (2008); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost Human?

Using data collected from an online questionnaire completed by 893 individuals, the study confirms that AI significantly enhances social media marketing by offering personalized content, optimizing influencer selection, and enabling real-time consumer interaction. These capabilities not only increase customer awareness but also improve user experience and purchase intentions. Key AI tools such as influencer marketing, content optimization, and customization are effective in capturing consumer attention, although further research is necessary to deepen understanding. By examining AI’s ability to analyze vast datasets and support targeted marketing efforts, the study contributes to both academic and practical discourse, offering insights that businesses can use to refine their AI-driven social media strategies. Ultimately, the research aims to guide marketers through the complexities of AI deployment, ensuring its benefits are fully realized for consumers. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; customer experience; customer purchase intention; social media marketing strategies","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., The value of brand equity, Journal of Business Strategy, 13, 4, pp. 27-32, (1992); Aghdaie S.F.A., Kazemi A., Mahdavinia S.H., The influence of psychological factors on customers information search behaviour, International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management, 33, 3, pp. 420-434, (2021); Ahmad M.F., The impact of big data processing framework for artificial intelligence within corporate marketing communication, International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 7, 4, pp. 384-388, (2018); 80% of companies will adopt intelligent automation by 2025, (2021); Arachchi H.D.M., Samarasinghe G.D., Impact of embedded AI mobile smart speech recognition on consumer attitudes towards AI and purchase intention across Generations X and Y, European Journal of Management Studies, 29, 1, pp. 3-29, (2024); Babashahi L., Barbosa C.E., Lima Y., Lyra A., Salazar H., Argolo M., Souza J.M.D., AI in the workplace: A systematic review of skill transformation in the industry, Administrative Sciences, 14, 6, (2024); Bernarto I., Berlianto M.P., Meilani Y.F.C.P., Masman R.R., Suryawan I.N., The influence of brand awareness, brand image, and brand trust on brand loyalty, Jurnal Manajemen, 24, 3, pp. 412-426, (2020); Black W., Babin B.J., Multivariate data analysis: Its approach, evolution, and impact, The great facilitator: Reflections on the contributions of Joseph F.

In a new departure for the field of brand communication, this study adopts and extends a semi-supervised machine-learning approach, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which incorporates human insights into the discovery and classification of topics. We used it to analyze tweets from businesses involved with an emerging food technology, cultured meat, and delineated four key message strategies used by these brands: providing functional, educational, corporate social responsibility, and relational content. We further ascertained the relationships between brands and the key topics embedded in their Twitter data. A comparison of model performance suggests that guided LDA can be an advantageous alternative to traditional LDA, which is characterized by high efficiency and immense popularity among researchers, but—because of its unsupervised nature—yields findings that can be difficult to interpret. The present study therefore has critical theoretical and methodological implications for communication and marketing scholars. © The Author(s) 2023.","computational text analysis; cultured meats; guided latent Dirichlet allocation; machine learning; social media marketing","","","","","","Center for Digital Agriculture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Center for Digital Agriculture, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, (2022-67024-36149); U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA","Funding text 1: Leona Yi-Fan Su, Yee Man Margaret Ng, and Yi-Cheng Wang would like to acknowledge funding support from the Center for Digital Agriculture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

To attract customers and encourage them to purchase products, firms need to identify the ideal virtual influencers for their businesses. Through the attachment between customers and influencers, firms may explore directions for influencer marketing strategies. This research aims to explore different dimensions of virtual influencers (VIs) by exploring social media influencers (SMIs) and computer-generated imagery (CGI) theory. Empirical research is implemented to analyse data collected from 299 respondents, alongside quantitative partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) research supported by Smart PLS software. The findings highlight that human likeness, source credibility, and attractive appearance have a positive influence on customer–influencer attachment and enhance purchasing intention. Through these results, this study also contributes several implications for managerial strategy and theoretical implications for further research.

Design/methodology/approach: The study was quantitative and cross-sectional and used a sample of 462 respondents drawn through a combination of purposive and convenience sampling techniques. The main method of data analysis was the covariance-based structural equation modeling used to assess the paths relationships, using the Amos v.23 software. Prior to that, a confirmatory factor analysis was done to assess the reliability and validity of the instrument. Findings: The empirical findings support the hypothesized relationship between digital marketing and purchase intention of banks’ services. Consumer engagement partially was found to mediate the association between digital marketing and purchase intentions. Finally, consumer trust moderates the relationship between digital marketing and consumer engagement. Research limitations/implications: Given digital marketing is evolving with new tools and channels coming up by the day, we recommend that future studies should explore others such as search engine marketing, affiliate marketing, content marketing, display advertisement etc. These will help give a broader perspective to the digital marketing strategy and its effect on consumers’ purchase intentions of banks’ services. Practical implications: The study makes a strong case for the use of multi-channel and/or integrative approach, improving digital infrastructure and systems, adopting new and emerging digital tools/channels such as artificial intelligence, chatbots among others to facilitate digital marketing strategy implementation while ensuring active consumer engagement. It further underscores the need for managers to build trust and regularly engage consumers through their digital marketing channels. Originality/value: The integration of the variables in the study provides new empirical understanding and extends knowledge in digital marketing theory. It also serves as a foundation for future studies to explore other areas in the digital marketing, especially from a developing digital economies perspective. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer trust;

However, many companies are still unclear about using social media marketing to get their advantages, particularly in an e-commerce environment. In this background, this study is proposed to examine the effects of social media marketing activities (SMMAs) (interactivity, informativeness, word-of-mouth-WOM, personalization, and trendiness) on relationship quality, such as commitment, trust, and satisfaction in order to predict consumers’ online repurchase intentions in China’s e-commerce environment. This study proposed a theoretical model by using the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory. Using a structured questionnaire and purposive sampling, this study examined the responses of 403 consumers through partial least square-structural equation modeling. The findings discovered that SMMAs significantly strengthen the relationship quality factors, such as commitment, trust, and satisfaction, which in turn positively increase consumer online repurchase intentions in China’s e-commerce industry. This is novel research that contributes to the S-O-R theory and provides several managerial guidelines that assist managers in improving their business performance in the e-commerce industry. This research also highlighted some limitations.

However, the scarcity of datasets and established metrics for their popularity evaluation poses a challenge in accurately reflecting their real-world distribution. In response, our work introduces a dataset and pioneers a cumulative distribution function-based standard tailored specifically for short-form videos. Our model, AMPS (Attention-based Multi-modal Popularity prediction model of Short-form videos) is designed to effectively forecast the popularity of these videos. Considering YouTube Shorts, typically confined to under one minute, our research capitalizes on complete video frames for a holistic prediction of popularity. AMPS harnesses BiLSTM with Self-Attention and Co-Attention mechanisms, enabling a deeper understanding of intra-modal and inter-modal relationships across various modalities. Leveraging full video frame representation, our model significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations against baseline models and machine learning algorithms consistently showcase AMPS' superiority in metrics like G-Mean, average F1-score, and Accuracy. Furthermore, when compared with other open social media datasets, our dataset coupled with AMPS consistently outperforms, affirming its robustness and reliability. Additionally, ablation studies underscore the effectiveness of AMPS' architecture and highlight the significance of each modality in predicting popularity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Multi-modal; Popularity prediction; Short-form content; Social media","algorithm; data set; holistic approach; machine learning; prediction; social media","","","","","Sungkyunkwan University, SKKU, (IITP-2024-2020-0-01816); Sungkyunkwan University, SKKU; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (RS-2023-00254129); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation ( IITP ) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. RS-2023-00254129 , Graduate School of Metaverse Convergence (Sungkyunkwan University), and No. IITP-2024-2020-0-01816 , ICAN Program).","Abdulsalam H., Skillicorn D.B., Martin P., Streaming random forests, Proc. of IDEAS '07, pp. 225-232, (2007); Abousaleh F.S., Cheng W.-H., Yu N.-H., Tsao Y., Multimodal deep learning framework for image popularity prediction on social media, IEEE Trans.

The examined text characteristics include i) readability indices, ii) text length, and iii) number of hashtags. A dataset of 135 image posts with description texts was exported from a Fashion retail Facebook business page providing post performance metrics in terms of engagement (expressed in likes) and awareness (expressed in reaches and impressions). Positive associations were indicated between all performance metrics and the text's length, as well as the number hashtags. The readability index of Gunning Fog revealed strong associations with both engagement and awareness, while the Flesch Kincaid reading ease index was associated only with awareness metrics of reaches and impressions. Overall, the results revealed that, the posts’ text which is easy to read, long (more than 31 words, or more than 321 characters), and contains many hashtags tends to achieve higher performance of engagement and awareness. This research contributes to prior literature by shedding light on the role of text characteristics of branded messaging in social media and offering insights for brand communication and social media message strategies. © 2022 The Author(s)","Big data analytics; Facebook analytics; Post characteristics; Social media engagement; Social media marketing; Text mining","","","","","","","","Ahn J., Son H., Chung A.D., Understanding public engagement on twitter using topic modeling: The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake case, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 1, 2, (2021); Antoniadis I., Xanthakou S., Assimakopoulos C., (2019); Batra J., Jain R., Tikkiwal V.A., Chakraborty A., A comprehensive study of spam detection in e-mails using bio-inspired optimization techniques, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 1, 1, (2021); Bianchi C., Andrews L., Consumer engagement with retail firms through social media: An empirical study in Chile, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 46, 4, pp. 364-385, (2018); Cheng W.W.H., Lam E.T.H., Chiu D.K.W., Social media as a platform in academic library marketing: A comparative study, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 46, 5, (2020); Colladon A.F., Gloor P., Iezzi D.F., Editorial introduction: The power of words and networks, International Journal of Information Management, 51, (2020); Consuegra D.M., Faraoni M., Diaz E., Ranfagni S., Exploring relationships among brand credibility, purchase intention and social media for fashion brands: A conditional mediation model, Journal of Global Fashion Marketing, 9, 3, pp. 237-251, (2018); Cortes J.D., Rivera L., Carbonelld K.B., Mission statements in universities: Readability and performance, European Research on Management and Business Economics, 28, 2, (2022); Cvijikj I.P., Spiegler E.D., Michahelles F., The effect of post type, category and posting day on user interaction level on Facebook, IEEE Third International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing, Boston, MA, pp. 810-813, (2011); Dale E., Chall J.S., The Concept of Readability, 26, (1949); Davenport J.R.A., (2014); Davidaviciene V., Davidavicius S., Tamosiuniene R., B2C marketing communication in social media: Fashion industry specifics, International Conference on Creative Business for Smart and Sustainable Growth (CREBUS), Sandanski, Bulgaria, pp. 1-4, (2019); Davis S.W., Horvath C., Gretry A., Belei N., Say what?

However, existing social media word-of-mouth analysis methods face challenges such as insufficient feature fusion, low accuracy of sentiment analysis, low precision of topic identification, as well as data sparsity and high annotation costs, which hinder the comprehensive and accurate analysis of word-of-mouth. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a social media word-of-mouth analysis model combining the Adaptive Vision Transformer (AViT) model and Enhanced BERT (EBERT) model. Firstly, we improve the traditional Transformer model by introducing dynamic attention mechanism and multi-scale processing to enhance its adaptability to different types of images, effectively adjusting computational resources, and enhancing attention to various parts of the images. Secondly, enhancements are made to the BERT model, including learnable positional encodings, sparse Transformer mechanism, and enhanced Masked Language Model, enabling better capture of semantic information and contextual relationships. Furthermore, by introducing the idea of multi-task learning, sentiment classification, topic recognition, and other tasks are combined to achieve comprehensive analysis of word-of-mouth. Through experiments on large-scale social media datasets, the proposed model not only achieves high accuracy in sentiment analysis and topic recognition tasks but also demonstrates good generalization ability, providing an effective social media marketing strategy and decision support tool for enterprises and marketing practitioners. © 2013 IEEE.","AViT; EBERT; Multi-task learning; social media; word-of-mouth analysis","Data mining; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Electronic commerce; Encoding (symbols); Image enhancement; Marketing; Semantics; Signal encoding; Social networking (online); Adaptation models; Adaptive vision; Adaptive vision transformer; Computational modelling; Encodings; Enhanced BERT; Multitask learning; Social media; Social networking (online); Solid modelling; Transformer; Word-of-mouth analyse; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Azzaakiyyah H.K., The impact of social media use on social interaction in contemporary society, Technol.

Based upon the theory of psychological reactance and psychoevolutionary theory of emotion, we hypothesize how such lifestyle changes affect consumers perceiving and responding to companies' communications messages. The theories also suggest that consumers in different cultures may respond to COVID-19 differently. To test our hypotheses, we implemented a Python scraper to collect companies’ Instagram posts pre- and during the COVID-19 lockdown. A machine learning algorithm was applied on the collected post photos to automatically identify certain photo characteristics, such as indoor versus outdoor, and with a single person versus many people; a text mining and sentiment analysis was implemented on the collected post captions to identify the salient emotion each caption exhibited, such as joy and anticipation. After that, we conducted a regression discontinuity analysis of photo characteristics or caption emotion on number of likes or comments to identify consumers’ response change due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimation results supported our hypotheses and suggested tactics that could improve consumer communications effectiveness in this changed time. Viewing COVID-19 as an example of a current event in the ever-changing world, this paper suggests that such events could impact consumer response and behavior, and that companies’ marketing and advertising strategies should be responsive to such events. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Consumer communications;

A quantitative cross-sectional survey design is employed, collecting data from 169 employees working in Malaysian educational institutions, including administrative staff, marketing personnel, academic leaders, and innovation team members from both public and private institutions. The research model is tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings reveal that all three dimensions of digital marketing positively impact organizational innovation climate, with artificial intelligence marketing demonstrating the strongest effect (β = 0.323), followed by video marketing (β = 0.289) and social media marketing (β = 0.247). Organizational innovation climate significantly influences product innovation performance (β = 0.683). While social media marketing and video marketing exhibit both direct and indirect effects on innovation performance, artificial intelligence marketing operates entirely through organizational innovation climate, indicating full mediation. The results suggest that educational institutions should implement advanced digital marketing tools alongside nurturing organizational structures that support innovation, with artificial intelligence marketing investments requiring simultaneous development of innovation-friendly climates. Strategic digital marketing significantly impacts educational product innovation through organizational innovation climate, enabling institutions to adapt to emerging insights and design innovative educational products tailored to student demands. © 2025, Future Publishing LLC.

The aim of this study is to investigate and determine the key factors guiding customer attitudes towards social media influencers, and, on that basis, to explore their effects on purchase intentions regarding advertised products or services. A total of 376 filled-in questionnaires from an online survey were analysed. The main characteristics of digital influencers’ behaviour that affect consumer perceptions have been systematized and categorized through a combination of both traditional and advanced data analysis methods. Structural equation modelling (SEM), machine learning and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods were selected to uncover the hidden dependencies between variables from the perspective of social media users. The developed models elucidate the underlying relationships that shape the acceptance mechanism of influencers’ messages. The obtained results provide specific recommendations for stakeholders across the social media marketing value chain. Marketers can make informed decisions and optimize influencer marketing strategies to enhance user experience and increase conversion rates. Working collaboratively, marketers and influencers can create impactful and successful marketing campaigns that resonate with the target audience and drive meaningful results. Customers benefit from more tailored and engaging influencer content that aligns with their interests and preferences, fostering a stronger connection with brands and potentially affecting their purchase decisions. As the perception of customer satisfaction is an individual and evolving process, stakeholders should organize regular evaluations of influencer marketing data and explore the possibilities to ensure the continuous improvement of this e-marketing channel. © 2024 by the authors.","behaviour intention; customer satisfaction; influencer marketing; machine learning; MCDM; PLS-SEM; purchase intention; social media marketing; structural equation modelling","Decision making; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Machine learning; Purchasing; Sales; Social networking (online); Strategic planning; Behaviour intentions; Customers' satisfaction; Influence marketing; Machine-learning; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; PLS-structural equation modeling; Purchase intention; Social media marketings; Structural equation models; Customer satisfaction","","","","","Bulgarian National Science Fund, BNSF; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (BG05M2OP001-1.002-0002); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research was funded by the National Science Fund, co-founded by the European Regional Development Fund, Grant No. BG05M2OP001-1.002-0002 \u201CDigitization of the Economy in a Big Data Environment\u201D.","Kotler P., Kartajaya H., Setiawan I., Marketing 4.0: Moving from Traditional to Digital, (2016); What is Influencer Marketing?

The research develops and examines an extensive S-O-R model, linking AI stimuli to customer perceptions of trust, privacy concerns, perceived usefulness, and, consequently, consumer engagement. Structural equation modeling was utilized to examine the gathered data and evaluate the hypotheses. The results confirm the hypothesis that AI-enabled personalization positively influences trust, privacy concerns, and perceived usefulness. Trust and perceived usefulness positively impact consumer engagement, while privacy concerns do not. Unexpectedly, AI-enabled personalization doesn't significantly affect customer engagement. By exploring the mediating roles of consumer perceptions, the results emphasize perceived utility and trust as a significant mediating factor, underscoring its crucial contribution to fostering positive interactions between users and technology. The research extends the SOR model in understanding AI's impact on consumer engagement, emphasizing trust and perceived usefulness as crucial mediators. For practical implications, businesses in social media marketing should prioritize trust-building, enhance user experience, address privacy concerns, and adopt a customer-centric approach. These insights provide valuable guidance for navigating AI driven personalization dynamics in social media marketing. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Consumer perception; Customer engagement;

Graphs can be utilized for a variety of purposes because this data can be either quantitative or qualitative. Graphs can be used to model different relationships and processes in physical, biological, and social media marketing systems, and in finding directions on a map. A graph with properties attached to its nodes and edges that emphasize its applicability to real-world systems is sometimes called a network. The idea of fuzzy sets has developed in numerous ways and across many areas since its establishment in 1965. Applications of this theory can be found in numerous fields for instance in recognition of patterns, management science, AI, computer science, medicine, also in control engineering. The progress of mathematics has reached a very high level and continues now. While classical graph theory is widely applied in several domains, there are instances where its outcomes can be subject to uncertainty. In order to address this challenge, the utilization of the fuzzy theory of graphs is adopted, as it offers more accurate outcomes. There is a lack of a parameterization tool in fuzzy graph theory, as a consequence Molodtsov introduced soft set theory, which is a rather recent way to talk about ambiguity and vagueness. It is becoming more and more popular among scholars and is a novel approach to uncertainty and ambiguity simulation. The concept of soft graphs offers a parameterized perspective on graphs. In this article, we defined some familiar graph families in a fuzzy soft (FS) environment and by calculating their degrees, derived important results for two versions of Sombor numbers. In the end, we discussed an application of calculated results and by comparison, checked the efficiency of Sombor numbers in a FS framework. © 2024 The Author(s)","Cross-border economic collaborations; Parameterized fuzzy graph; Second and third Sombor numbers; Soft fuzzy graph","Fuzzy sets; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Marketing; Pattern recognition; Cross-border; Cross-border economic collaboration; Fuzzy graph; Parameterized; Parameterized fuzzy graph; Second and third sombor number; Soft fuzzy graph; Topological number; Uncertainty; Parameterization","","","","","","","Abbasi F., Et al., Realistic solution of fuzzy critical path problems, case study: the airport's cargo ground operation systems, Granul.

Manouba, ESEN, Tunisia","With the rise of social media platforms for marketing purposes, the central dilemma for researchers and policymakers lies in choosing effective data analysis tools to improve marketing decisions. In the academic literature, numerous articles have discussed clustering techniques for analysing social media data, from a perspective of data mining or social media marketing. However, few studies have attempted to synthesise results obtained from both perspectives. This research aims to (1) offer a structured overview of existing literature on clustering methods for marketing strategies and (2) compare three topic modelling techniques applied to extract the main topics evoked in the corpus of papers. Indeed, topic modelling emerges as a valuable tool for extracting relevant information from big data in general and more specifically from extensive scientific papers. Based on a thematic analysis, the extracted topics were classified according to the following categories: fields, marketing strategies and technologies. Results prove that latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the most effective technique in this context. Furthermore, this study provides an overview of clustering techniques and technologies used for marketing strategies in studied fields. These findings help researchers and practitioners to select the best techniques and technologies for extracting marketing knowledge from big data. © 2024 Telecommunications Association Inc..

This paper delves into the dual facets of AI-driven social media marketing techniques, investigating both their advantageous and detrimental impacts. It shows that by leveraging AI, businesses can achieve unprecedented levels of personalisation, engagement and efficiency in their marketing strategies, leading to enhanced customer experiences and increased brand loyalty. AI algorithms analyse vast amounts of data to identify trends and predict consumer behaviour, enabling precise targeting and optimised advertising spend. The paper utilises a qualitative research method to explore the AI-driven social media marketing techniques used by digital marketing and social media marketing professionals. The findings suggest that reliance on AI may perpetuate biases embedded in the training data, leading to ethical concerns and a loss of trust among consumers. This paper highlights the need for robust regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines to mitigate risks while harnessing the full potential of AI in social media marketing. Ultimately, understanding both the bright and dark sides of AI-driven marketing is crucial for developing strategies that are not only effective but also ethical and sustainable. © Henry Stewart Publications.","advantages; artificial intelligence; drawbacks; machine learning; social media marketing; social media marketing techniques","","","","","","","","Lang V., Lang V., Digitalization and digital transformation.

Using an image classification machine learning algorithm (Google Vision AI) on restaurants’ Instagram posts, this study analyzes how the visual characteristics of product offerings (i.e., their food) relate to social media engagement. Results demonstrate that food images that are more confidently evaluated by Google Vision AI (a proxy for food typicality) are positively associated with engagement (likes and comments). A follow-up experiment shows that exposure to typical-appearing foods elevates positive affect, suggesting they are easier to mentally process, which drives engagement. Therefore, contrary to conventional social media practices and food industry trends, the more typical a food appears, the more social media engagement it receives. Using Google Vision AI to identify what product offerings receive engagement presents an accessible method for marketers to understand their industry and inform their social media marketing strategies. © 2022","Consumer engagement; Food; Google Vision AI; Machine learning; Processing fluency; Social media marketing","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (139286, 430-2019-00218, 435-2018-1319); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the help from Ngoc My Vo, Maxwell Poole, Portchia Sedlezky-Anselmo, Alyssa Counsell, Rishad Habib, Shengkun Xie, Ali Tezer, and Zhe Zhang in preparing this manuscript.

The study focuses on the impact of social media advertisements and investigates the mediating influence of waste reduction intentions on actual behavior. This underscores the significance of contextual and emotional variables in comprehending consumer behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a cross-sectional research methodology to examine the impact of SMMAs on the behavior of Generation Z consumers in Pakistan’s food service industry with regard to reducing food waste. A study was conducted to investigate the restaurant purchasing behaviors of a sample consisting of 449 individuals belonging to the millennial generation, often known as Generation Z. Findings: The majority of variables related to SMMA, except for interactivity and personalization, were shown to have a positive impact on individuals’ intents to reduce food waste. The study observed a significant relationship between consumers’ intentions to decrease waste and their actual behavior in waste reduction. Furthermore, this relationship was shown to be influenced by the mediating role of waste reduction intention. Originality/value: Examining how social media affects Pakistani Generation Z’s efforts to reduce food waste is what makes this study distinctive. According to the research, the majority of social media factors positively influence intentions to reduce waste. The relationship between intentions and actual behavior, which highlights the impact of social media campaigns and emotional aspects in promoting waste reduction, is one of the important conclusions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food waste reduction behavior; Generation Z; Social media marketing activities (SMMA); Theory of planned behavior (TPB)","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Food waste; Food waste reduction behavior; Generation Z; Marketing activities; Reduction behavior; Social media marketings; Social medium marketing activity; Theory of planned behavior; Waste reduction; Consumer behavior","","","","","","","Aggarwal R., Mittal S., Impact of social media marketing activities on purchase intentions via customer equity drivers: an empirical case study on smartphone brands, International Journal of Online Marketing, 12, 1, pp. 1-19, (2022); Aloysius N., Ananda J., Mitsis A., Pearson D., Why people are bad at leftover food management?

Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training. © 2023 by the authors.","decision-focused learning; differentiable greedy; edge bundling; end-to-end learning; graph visualization; influence maximization","Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Visualization; Decision-focused learning; Differentiable greedy; Edge bundling; End to end; End-to-end learning; Graph visualization; Influence maximizations; Influential nodes; Maximization problem; Model prediction; Data visualization","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This research was funded by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE).","Chen W., Wang C., Wang Y., Scalable Influence Maximization for Prevalent Viral Marketing in Large-Scale Social Networks, Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’10, pp. 1029-1038; Bond R., Fariss C., Jones J., Kramer A., Marlow C., Settle J., Fowler J., A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization, Nature, 489, pp. 295-298, (2012); Bedi M., Social networks, government surveillance, and the Fourth Amendment Mosaic Theory, BUL Rev, 94, (2014); Kempe D., Kleinberg J., Tardos E., Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’03, pp. 137-146; Sakaue S., Differentiable Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization: Guarantees, Gradient Estimators, and Applications, Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 130, pp. 28-36, (2021); Anscombe F.J., Graphs in Statistical Analysis, Am.

Taking the emotional tone of posts into account, the effect of vivid, interactive, informative, entertaining and practical features of posts on consumer interactions are evaluated across English- and Turkish-speaking markets. Methodology: Inspired by the conceptual framework proposed in previous literature, features were extracted computationally using natural language processing from platform X posts of 33 Fortune 500 brands from various industries from June 2016 to June 2021. Following evaluation of regression models on alternative distributions of the dependent variable, which is total number of likes, shares and comments, random subspace regression using bootstrap resampling was applied to calculate an importance score and evaluate the effect of features. Findings: Consumers in English- and Turkish-speaking markets perceive and engage with content differently. While informative and entertaining posts resonate more with English speakers, emotions play a broader role for Turkish speakers. English-speaking audience prefers happy and vivid daytime messages with questions, while Turkish-speaking audience is drawn to angry messages, lean toward nighttime posts. Originality: This research is a pioneer to evaluate the factors that influence brands' platform X post engagements across markets of different cultural orientation. Beyond assessing the distinctions in brand post elements, the role of emotional content in brand messages were also analyzed across English- and Turkish-speaking markets. © 2024, Tanaltay Altug, Ozturkcan Selcen and Kasap Nihat.","Brand post popularity; Consumer engagement; Digital branding; Platform X; Social media marketing; Twitter","","","","","","Sabanci Business School","This manuscript disseminates partial results from the thesis studies of Altug Tanaltay, an A.B.D.

The survey was administered to a non-probabilistic convenience sample of 202 individuals recruited primarily from social media platforms where SuperBock has an active presence. The convenience sampling method is preferred due to its ease of implementation in research design, cost effectiveness and time efficiency. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using SPSS software. The results indicate that all dimensions of SMMA on SuperBock's Instagram have a positive impact on consumers' purchase intentions. The dimension 'Advertising' exerts the most significant positive impact, followed by 'Emotional Value' and 'Intensity of e-WOM'. It was found that e-WOM dimensions play a significant role in influencing consumers' purchasing decisions. This study advances our understanding of how Instagram influences purchase intentions for SuperBock. The use of a non-probabilistic convenience sample limits the generalisability of conclusions. © 2024 Sciendo.

Social media marketers have utilized information spillover within these platforms to reach a larger customer base. This information spillover also exists across groups of users within the platform and enhances returns from social media advertising. Thus, this information spillover can be utilized to strategically sequence targeted advertising to amplify the returns from social media ads. In this paper, we present a theoretical model for information retention and show that the sequential advertising strategy is effective in targeting groups of users on a social media platform. In addition, we provide empirical evidence through two series of randomized field experiments. From experiments for a health services organization, we find that sequential advertising campaigns provide 23% more clicks when compared to campaigns that target groups simultaneously, which translates to a saving of 18.7% in the advertising budget to achieve similar results as simultaneous advertising. Additionally, we found that sequential advertising campaigns targeting a smaller group first followed by a larger group provide 10.7% additional clicks when compared to targeting a larger group first followed by a smaller group. These results were consistent for consumer packaged goods that were advertised on Facebook and Twitter. These results provide implications for social media advertising research and practice. © 2023 The Authors.

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) powered social media offers digital capabilities for organizations to select, screen, detect and predict problems with possible solutions through digital health data. Both the patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations. This paper examines the impact of responsible AI on businesses using insights from analysis of 25 in-depth interviews of health care professionals. The exploratory analysis conducted revealed that abiding by the responsible AI principles can allow healthcare businesses to better take advantage of the improved effectiveness of their social media marketing initiatives with their users. The analysis is further used to offer research propositions and conclusions, and the contributions and limitations of the study have been discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Consumer trust theory; Digital health; Information sharing theory; Responsible AI; Social media marketing; Technology acceptance model","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Health care; Marketing; Consumer trust theory; Digital health; Health care professionals; Information sharing; Information sharing theory; Responsible artificial intelligence; Social media; Social media marketings; Technology acceptance model; Trust theories; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Ahmed W., Bath P.A., Sbaffi L., Demartini G., Novel insights into views towards H1N1 during the 2009 Pandemic: a thematic analysis of Twitter data, Health Information & Libraries Journal, 36, 1, pp. 60-72, (2019); Arrieta A.B., Diaz-Rodriguez N., Del Ser J., Bennetot A., Tabik S., Barbado A., Herrera F., Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Information Fusion, 58, pp. 82-115, (2020); Benjamins R.; Benjamins R., Barbado A., Sierra D., Responsible AI by Design in Practice, (2019); Booth R.G., Allen B.N., Jenkyn K.M.B., Li L., Shariff S.Z., Youth mental health services utilization rates after a large-scale social media campaign: population-based interrupted time-series analysis, JMIR Mental Health, 5, 2, pp. 1-15, (2018); Briand A., Almeida H., Meurs M.J., Analysis of social media posts for early detection of mental health conditions, Advances in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 133-143, (2018); Brownstein J., Clark S., Freifeld C., Lawrence C., Madoff, Digital disease detection — Harnessing the web for public health surveillance, The New England Journal of Medicine, 360, 21, pp. 2153-2157, (2009); Burkhardt R., Hohn N., Wigley C., Leading your organization to responsible AI, Mckinsey Analytics, pp. 1-8, (2019); Carson D., Gilmore A., Perry C., Gronhaug K., Qualitative marketing research, (2001); Chenail R.J., Interviewing the investigator: Strategies for addressing instrumentation and researcher bias concerns in qualitative research, Qualitative Report, 16, 1, pp. 255-262, (2011); Cheng L., Varshney K.R., Liu H., Socially Responsible AI Algorithms: Issues, Purposes, and Challenges, (2021); Clarke R., (2019); Coiera E., Guide to health informatics, (2015); Constant D., Kiesler S., Sproull L., What’s mine is ours, or is it?

A descriptive analytical approach was used, combining both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore how these digital strategies can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Data were collected through a structured survey of 600 participants, including 300 bank staff and 300 clients. The analysis involved multiple regression, correlation analysis, variance inflation factor (VIF) checks, and robustness testing to ensure the reliability of the findings. The results show that mobile applications have the strongest influence on customer engagement (β = 0.78, p < 0.01), followed by websites (r = 0.72, p < 0.01), social media marketing (β = 0.65, p < 0.01), and email marketing (r = 0.54, p < 0.01). The study also found generational differences in the use of digital tools: younger customers prefer mobile applications and social media, while older customers engage more with websites and email marketing. In addition, the research identifies key challenges in digital marketing, such as technological limitations, organizational resistance, and concerns about data privacy. It emphasizes the need for stronger cybersecurity measures and compliance with regulatory requirements. This study provides useful insights for banking professionals and decision-makers to improve digital marketing strategies and build long-term customer relationships.

The Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were used in searching for articles. There were 884 (433 publications from the Web of Science and 451 articles from Scopus) papers analysed. Based on the analysis of two databases, the number of publications from the Web of Science database showed a significant increase yearly. In comparison, the Scopus database showed fluctuating growth every year. One of the countries that enormously contributed to the research was China, which can be seen from the author’s and country’s analyses. The ACM International Conference Proceeding Series was the most contributing conference proceedings. Based on the keyword results, there are five keywords that appear most often. Referring to the data from the last two years (2021–2022), the keywords “machine learning” and “social media marketing” are the most frequently used. These two keywords are most often associated with e-commerce and social media keywords. These findings are expected to provide a substantial understanding towards e-commerce and social media research, particularly in the Asian region. This paper will assist researchers in understanding new topics, collaborating with other researchers, and determining relevant sources and countries. Analysed keywords can inspire new research. Consequently, researchers can learn about new technology, societal changes, and impending challenges and opportunities by tracking keyword trends. © 2023, Intellectual Research and Development Education Foundation (YRPI).

The segmentation carried out in the article made it possible to develop a matrix of segmentation of the target audience, which is grouped by factors of age, social status, interests, requests and values. By real practical results of advertising campaign analysis, three areas were identified: targeted advertising, contextual advertising, and social media marketing. Based on the ranking according to the target audience segmentation matrix, specific methodological recommendations for the practical implementation of the system of using marketing tools, depending on the type of target audience, have been developed. The developed recommendations determine the possibility of selecting the most effective types of advertising for each individual type of target audience, and the developed segmentation matrix, which contains a set of interests, requests, and values for each selected group, can be used to improve advertising campaigns and increase their effectiveness. © Economic Affairs (New Delhi).All rights reserved","advertising; business management; content strategy; digital strategy; Marketing; SMM","","","","","","","","Apasrawirote D., Yawised K., Muneesawang P., Digital marketing capability: the mystery of business capabilities, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 40, 4, pp. 477-496, (2022); Bapat D., Khandelwal R., Antecedents and consequences of consumer hope for digital payment apps services, J.

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding the influence of these organizations' social media marketing strategies on their followers. The study aims to investigate the effect of environmental organizations’ social media marketing activities on brand image, online word-of-mouth communications, and the pro-environmental behaviors of followers. A quantitative approach was used in the research, and data were gathered through online questionnaires from 529 users who actively follow ten well-known environmental organizations on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn in Türkiye. The theoretical model and hypotheses were tested with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The social media marketing components of environmental organizations were defined as awareness, interaction, timeliness, customization, and advertising. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the social media marketing components of environmental organizations' awareness, timeliness, and interaction have a positive effect on the pro-environmental behaviors of the followers. At the same time, these components have a significant effect on brand image and online word-of-mouth in environmental organizations. In addition, it has been demonstrated that brand image and online word-of-mouth in environmental organizations significantly affect on the pro-environmental behaviors of the followers. The findings suggest that social media serves as an effective platform for environmental organizations to enhance their brand image and promote pro-environmental behavior. However, these organizations face challenges regarding the effectiveness of advertisements and the personalization of communication on these platforms. © Authors retain all.","Brand Image; Environmental Organizations; Pro-Environmental Behavior; Social Media Marketing; Word-of-Mouth","","","","","","","","Gomes S., Lopes J.

Moreover, the study investigates the moderating effect of advertising expenditure on this proposed relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Random effect regression models were developed in Stata to examine the associations between SMM performance indicators, advertising expenditure, and restaurant firm revenue. Twelve years of SMM data from brands' Facebook pages were collected with a web scraper built in Python. Natural language processing was used to analyze the sentiment of user-generated content (UGC). Findings: The results suggest that restaurant annual sales revenue increases as the volume of brand posts, “like”s, “share”s and positive comments on restaurants' Facebook pages increase. However, the total number of comments and the number of negative comments show non-significant associations with revenue. Firm advertising expenditure negatively moderates the relationships between sales revenue and the number of “like”s, “share”s, total comments and positive comments. Practical implications: Restaurants benefit from making frequent posts on SNSs. Promotions that motivate online users to “like”, share, and comment on brand posts should be implemented. Firms with limited advertising budgets are encouraged to actively create buzz on SNSs due to evidenced stronger effects of UGC on sales performance than large advertisers. Originality/value: This research bridges the gap by studying the effects of individual SMM performance indicators on restaurant financial outcomes. The findings support the effectiveness of SMM; and, for the first time, demonstrate that SMM could generate a more profound impact for firms with low advertising budgets. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising expenditure; Audience engagement; Consumer sentiment; Natural language processing; Restaurant performance; Sales revenue; Social media marketing; Web scraping","","","","","","University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV; William F.

However, the users of social media services may perceive that personalized content is intrusive. These two components may influence consumers’ purchase intention in social media personalization campaigns. Thus, this positivism empirical research proposes a theoretical framework named PI2 using the personalization-intrusiveness-intention, as well as a success measurement based upon privacy calculus theory for effective social media personalization campaigns. Further, we investigated digital mnemonics’ potential influences with emotion as social information theory and different degrees of product involvement together with the model. Based upon the analysis of a total of 800 social media users, the results indicated that personalization positively affected but intrusiveness negatively affected the purchase intention. Furthermore, personalization significantly affected purchase intention through intrusiveness and the interaction of personalization with digital mnemonics negatively influenced consumers’ purchase intention on high involvement ads. In the post-hoc analysis, the moderating effect of users’ demographic variables was found to have some influence on the PI2 framework. The findings of this research provide theoretical and managerial implications for researchers and field practitioners in social media personalization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital mnemonic; Emotion as social information; Intrusiveness; Privacy calculus theory; Social media personalization","Calculations; Economic and social effects; Information theory; Sales; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Calculus theories; Digital mnemonic; Emotion as social information; Intrusiveness; Personalizations; Privacy calculus theory; Purchase intention; Social information; Social media; Social medium personalization; Purchasing","","","","","Sungkyunkwan University, SKKU","This paper was supported by SKKU Excellence in Research Award Research Fund , Sungkyunkwan University, 2021.

Based on the impact of these platforms, some ‘influencers’ are highlighted. These influencers wield significant power, shaping consumer behavior. This influence spawned the concept of influencer marketing, where companies leverage these personalities to advertise their products. YouTube stands out as a prominent platform in this trend. However, considering the limited number of influencers and their concepts, the majority of companies, which hope to conduct their marketing campaigns with influencers face challenges in identifying suitable influencers for their campaigns. With this trend, we introduce GNN-IR, a graph neural network for influencer recommendation, based on the connections between companies and influencers of YouTube, one of the largest content platforms. In developing GNN-IR, we adopted a data-driven methodology utilizing a meticulously curated dataset collected in-house. Our dataset comprises a total of 25,174 relationship entries between advertisers and influencers, involving 1,886 distinct advertisers and 3,812 unique YouTube influencers. It encompasses diverse data modalities, including images, text, and assorted metadata. The data was sourced from two primary platforms: YouTube and ugwanggi. Ugwanggi provided valuable insights into the relationships between advertisers and influencers via their information. Meanwhile, YouTube offered more comprehensive and detailed influencer-centric information. We employed PyTorch Geometric to construct a bipartite graph representing interconnected data. Our recommendation system operates via link prediction, suggesting the Top-k influencers to advertisers based on the calculated connection probability between nodes. To assess GNN-IR's performance, we employed a range of evaluation metrics. For link prediction, we measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Additionally, in the recommendation phase, we evaluated Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score@k. Using GNN-IR and incorporating profile images from YouTube, keyword features, metadata, and sentiment gleaned from YouTube comments, we achieved Precision levels of 96.51% at k=1 and 93.68% at k=10. Based on the experimental results, several implications and limitations are presented.

Despite this, little attention has been given to its unintended negative consequences. In this paper, the authors examine both the practitioner and academic sides of ethical AI. In doing so, the authors conduct an extensive review of the AI literature to identify potential issues pertaining to three areas: individual consumers, societal and legal. The authors identify gaps and offer questions to drive future research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors review recent academic literature on AI in marketing journals, and top ethical principles from three top technology developers (Google, IBM and Meta) in conjunction with media reports of negative AI incents. They also identify gaps and opportunities for future research based on this review. Findings: The bibliographic review reveals a small number of academic papers in marketing that focus on ethical considerations for AI adoption. The authors highlight concerns for academic researchers, marketing practitioners and AI developers across three main areas and highlight important issues relating to interactive marketing. Originality/value: This paper highlights the under-researched negative outcomes of AI adoption. Through an extensive literature review, coupled with current responsible AI principles adopted by major technology companies, this research provides a framework for examining the dark side of AI. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Business ethics; Computer-mediated environments; Human–computer interaction; Information technology; Intellectual property; Interactivity; Marketing ethics; Personalization; Privacy; Social media marketing; Virtual agents","","","","","","","","Adams P., Dove pledges to not use AI models in lieu of real women in its advertising.

In this paper, the determinants of consumer engagement in firm-generated content on Facebook are examined in a higher education institutions (HEIs) context. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 1,981 Facebook brand posts of 16 Brazilian HEIs and thoroughly analyzed with seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Findings: The results indicated that the type of media does not increase the user's engagement. The emotional content, on the other hand, increases the number of likes and shares and not comments. An interaction between dimensions, type of media and content is relevant disclosed to increase engagement metrics, while characteristics related to the day and time of posting are not relevant. Research limitations/implications: This study analyzes the factors that influence consumer engagement in brand messages published on Facebook, in the context of higher education institutions. Specifically, the authors seek to examine the influence that emanates from the likes, comments and shares: (1) factors related to the type of media (interactivity and liveliness); (2) content-related factors (remuneration, emotional, entertainment and informational); and (3) factors related to posting (day of the week and time of day). Practical implications: In the context of educational services, social media is increasingly present, remarkably in HEI marketing practices. Previous studies have shown that universities use social media (mainly Facebook) to promote interactivity with students. The study presents the key characteristics of the postings by the HEIs, with an emphasis on the liveliness, the interactivity of the media, and the information content of the posts. It stands out by the examination of the most relevant factors that influence Facebook engagement, and by providing evidence on the strength of the factors related to post features that influence user engagement. Originality/value: The research contributes to the proposition and empirical test of a predictive model of consumer engagement on Facebook, which can predict engagement in an HEI context.

Nevertheless, given the sensitive nature of financial information, maintaining stringent confidentiality is of paramount importance. This study aims to examine the impact of social media marketing (SMM) dimensions on customer knowledge management (CKM) in UAE public banks, focusing on the moderating role of banking confidentiality. The study utilized a quantitative methodology with a correlational framework; data were collected from 283 respondents, who are active customers of First Abu Dhabi Bank, Emirates NBD, and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, through a structured questionnaire. These customers were surveyed to understand their interaction with social media campaigns, the information banks request from them, their willingness to share personal data, and their perceptions of safety and legal protections. The results revealed a strong positive relationship between SMM dimensions and CKM, with SMM explaining 65.9% of the variance in CKM outcomes (R2 = 0.659, p < 0.01). Among the SMM dimensions, customization had the highest impact (R2 = 0.766), followed by word-of-mouth (R2 = 0.697) and aesthetics (R2 = 0.651). Additionally, confidentiality was found to significantly enhance the effectiveness of SMM, with a moderating effect increasing explained variance by 6.5% (ΔR2 = 0.065, β = 0.25, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that public banks in the UAE should integrate personalized SMM strategies with stringent confidentiality measures to optimize CKM. This approach not only enhances customer engagement but also builds trust, fostering sustainable growth in the digital era. © Abdelrehim Awad, Ahmed Moustafa Aldabousi, Seham Albatal, 2024.","banking sector; confidentiality; customer engagement; data protection; digital marketing; financial data; personalization; privacy; social networks; trust","","","","","","Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at University of Bisha","The authors are thankful to the Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at University of Bisha for supporting this work through the Fast-Track Research Support Program.","Alaverdian L., Romanenko O., Modern marketing tools and internet technologies in Ukrainian business in the formation of marketing strategies, Marketing and Digital Technologies, 4, 4, pp. 93-102, (2020); Ali H.

This study examined the multidimensional impact of influencer marketing by analyzing engagement metrics, marketing effectiveness, and consumer decision-making processes, based on consumers in the Greek sector. Through a structured methodological framework, the research employed a questionnaire-based survey, statistical modeling, and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) scenarios to assess consumer interactions with influencer-driven content. Findings highlight that while influencer marketing enhances brand engagement and sales, its effectiveness varies based on content authenticity, transparency, and user trust. Additionally, consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by social media visibility, personalized marketing strategies, and digital platform usability. This study underscores the need for strategic influencer selection and information-driven marketing optimization to sustain long-term consumer engagement.

The research’s aim is to investigate trends and patterns in the area of digital marketing research from 1979 to June 2020 through a bibliometric analysis technique. A total of 924 articles published were obtained from the Scopus database for the analysis. In this paper, we examine variant bar charts including the year of publication, writer, publication, keyword, and country to provide more insights. Results indicated that digital marketing research steadily increased during the study period and the maximum publications occurred in the year 2019 that reach to 163 documents. The trend of publications is still growing. The top 20 documents based on the times cited per year (TCpY) were qualitatively analyzed. The largest number of multiple (MCP) and single (SCP) publications was from the USA, followed by the UK and China. The top 20 most repeated authors’ keywords out of 1909 with their trends illustrated. The “real-time bidding”, “machine learning”, “big data”, “social media marketing”, and “influencer marketing” are the emerging keywords in the digital Marketing area. This bibliometric study generally provides the whole image of the field and suggests that researchers focus on novel areas to add new findings and knowledge in the literature if they conduct digital marketing research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Bibliometric; Digital marketing; Electronic commerce marketing; Search engine marketing; VoSviewer","","","","","","","","The 100 most cited papers in’industrial design’: A bibliometric analysis.

This research draws on the conceptual framework of influence tactics to provide insights into how specific tactics—internalization (e.g., offering objective information), compliance (e.g., exerting demands), and ingratiation (e.g., expressing emotions)— embedded in brand communications impact brand message sharing. By developing a machine learning model, this study analyzes a dataset of 893,054 brand-related tweets from 122 S&P 500 brands and demonstrates that these three influence tactics significantly enhance brand message sharing. In particular, ingratiation exerts a stronger influence on brand message sharing compared to internalization and compliance. Moreover, a high level of consistency or a high level of variation in the influence tactics used in sequences of posted messages boosts brand message sharing. Additionally, tailoring ingratiation and compliance tactics to feminine and masculine brand names, respectively, can further enhance the effectiveness of brand message sharing. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Brand communication; Brand Message sharing; Influence tactic; Machine learning; Social media marketing; Text mining","","","","","","","","Aaker J.L., Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997); Antonetti P., Crisafulli B., Revisiting power messaging in service failures: Pitfalls and proposed solutions, Psychology & Marketing, 39, 11, pp. 2072-2095, (2022); Barasch A., Berger J., Broadcasting and narrowcasting: How audience size affects what people share, Journal of Marketing Research, 51, 3, pp. 286-299, (2014); Batra R., Keller K.L., Integrating marketing communications: New findings, new lessons, and new ideas, Journal of Marketing, 80, 6, pp. 122-145, (2016); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Berger J., Humphreys A., Ludwig S., Moe W.W., Netzer O., Schweidel D.A., Uniting the tribes: Using text for Marketing insight, Journal of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Carnevale M., Luna D., Lerman D., Brand linguistics: A theory-driven framework for the study of language in branding, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 34, 2, pp. 572-591, (2017); (2012); Cassidy K.W., Kelly M.H., Sharoni L.J., Inferring gender from name phonology, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 128, 3, pp. 362-381, (1999); Chapelle O., Chi M., Zien A., A continuation method for semi-supervised SVMs, Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 185-192, (2006); Choi B.C.F., Jiang Z.J., Xiao B., Kim S.S., Embarrassing exposures in online social networks: An integrated perspective of privacy invasion and relationship bonding, Information Systems Research, 26, 4, pp. 675-694, (2015); Cruz R.E., Leonhardt J.M., Pezzuti T., Second person pronouns enhance consumer involvement and brand attitude, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 39, 1, pp. 104-116, (2017); Cuddy A.J.C., Glick P., Beninger A., The dynamics of warmth and competence judgments, and their outcomes in organizations, Research in Organizational Behavior, 31, pp. 73-98, (2011); Dalton-Puffer C., Negotiating interpersonal meanings in naturalistic classroom discourse: Directives in content-and-language-integrated classrooms, Journal of Pragmatics, 37, 8, pp. 1275-1293, (2005); De Vries L., Gensler S., Leeflang P.S.H., Popularity of brand posts on brand fan pages: An investigation of the effects of social media marketing, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 26, 2, pp. 83-91, (2012); Delgado-Ballester E., Navarro A., Sicilia M., Revitalising brands through communication messages: The role of brand familiarity, European Journal of Marketing, 46, 1-2, pp. 31-51, (2012); Dhaoui C., Webster C.M., Brand and consumer engagement behaviors on facebook brand pages: Let's have a (positive) conversation, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 38, 1, pp. 155-175, (2021); Dillard J.P., Shen L., On the nature of reactance and its role in persuasive health communication, Communication Monographs, 72, 2, pp. 144-168, (2005); Eckert C., Hohberger J., Addressing endogeneity without instrumental variables: An evaluation of the gaussian copula approach for management research, Journal of Management, 49, 4, pp. 1460-1495, (2023); Fiske S.T., Venus and mars or down to earth: Stereotypes and realities of gender differences, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 5, 6, pp. 688-692, (2010); Fletcher-Brown J., Turnbull S., Viglia G., Chen T., Pereira V., Vulnerable consumer engagement: How corporate social media can facilitate the replenishment of depleted resources, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 38, 2, pp. 518-529, (2021); Frazier G.L., Rody R.C., The use of influence strategies in interfirm relationships in industrial product channels, Journal of Marketing, 55, 1, pp. 52-69, (1991); Frazier G.L., Summers J.O., Interfirm influence strategies and their application within distribution channels, Journal of Marketing, 48, 3, pp. 43-55, (1984); Gendron M., Lindquist K.A., Barsalou L., Barrett L.F., Emotion words shape emotion percepts, Emotion, 12, 2, pp. 314-325, (2012); George G., Osinga E.C., Lavie D., Scott B.A., Big data and data science methods for management research, Academy of Management Journal, 59, 5, pp. 1493-1507, (2016); Gerber A.S., Gimpel J.G., Green D.P., Shaw D.R., How large and long-lasting are the persuasive effects of televised campaign ads?

This approach aims to decipher the brand narrative and gauge user engagement. In the dynamic realm of social media marketing, TikTok has emerged as a key platform in shaping brand perception. This research specifically concentrates on Airbnb’s content, distinguishing between official narratives and user-generated content (UGC). Notably, themes of “Travel” dominate official posts, contrasting with “Real Estate” and “Business” in UGC. The methodology employed involves advanced data collection techniques, including web scraping for textual data and artificial intelligence for transcribing human audio to text. The findings reveal that UGC commands greater engagement and volume compared to Airbnb’s own brand content, underscoring the increasing significance of user involvement in brand storytelling. An analysis of the study results is conducted using linguistic natural processing (LNP) for the sentiment base, and the vector space model for emotion analysis. Sentiment analysis reveals a predominance of the emotion “happiness” and a significant presence of “surprise” in the posts, both of which are critical for audience engagement. Moreover, the study indicates a high approval rate for Airbnb-related content, reflecting a positive reception of the brand. Additionally, the research observes that influencers, particularly nano influencers, have higher engagement rates, indicating that their authenticity and relatability appeal especially to Generation Z audiences. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between brand narrative, user engagement, and sentiment on TikTok but also offers valuable insights into effective brand image construction and propagation in the digital era, highlighting the importance of diverse emotions in enhancing audience engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.","influencers;

Effective and consistent content development, however, remains technically demanding and time consuming, prompting most to employ, at non-negligible costs, social media marketing specialists for content planning and development. Objectives: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the ability of presently available artificial intelligence (AI) models to assist plastic surgeons in their social media content development and sharing plans. Methods: An AI large language model was prompted on the study's objectives through a series of standardized user interactions. Social media platforms of interest, on which the AI model was prompted, included Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter). Results: A 1-year, entirely AI-generated social media plan, comprising a total of 1091 posts for the 3 aforementioned social media platforms, is presented. Themes of the AI-generated content proposed for each platform were classified in 6 categories, including patient-related, practice-related, educational, ""uplifting,""interactive, and promotional posts. Overall, 91 publicly recognized holidays and observant and awareness days were incorporated into the content calendars. The AI model demonstrated an ability to differentiate between the distinct formats of each of the 3 social media platforms investigated, generating unique ideas for each, and providing detailed content development and posting instructions, scripts, and post captions, leveraging features specific to each platform. Conclusions: By providing detailed and actionable social media content creation and posting plans to plastic surgeons, presently available AI models can be readily leveraged to assist in and significantly alleviate the burden associated with social media account management, content generation, and potentially patient conversion.  © The Author(s) 2024.","","Artificial Intelligence;

In this vein, the present study seeks to elucidate the impact of social media marketing activities on electronic word-of-mouth and student intention to engage with these platforms. Specifically, we aim to investigate how activities such as entertainment, interaction, trend analysis, personalisation, and advertising, conducted by leading digital e-learning platforms on social networks, shape user behaviour. Furthermore, we endeavour to assess the mediating role of electronic word-of-mouth, with a particular emphasis on the educational attainment level of respondents. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a cross-sectional quantitative study involving a sample of 303 participants, all of whom were users of at least one electronic learning platform. Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyse the proposed model comprehensively. Our findings underscore the substantial influence of social media activities on both electronic word-of-mouth and students' propensity to utilise these platforms. Notably, our multi-group analysis, stratified by educational level, reveals nuanced patterns. Specifically, university and technical users demonstrate a heightened association between social media marketing activities, electronic word-of-mouth, and intention to use, reflecting their urgency in accessing the service and thereby exhibiting a greater receptivity to digital platform activities. Conversely, postgraduate users place greater significance on electronic word-of-mouth, underscoring the importance of authentic user perceptions in shaping their engagement decisions. © The Authors.","e-Learning; Electronic word of mouth; Intention to use; Multigroup analysis; Social media marketing activities","","","","","","","","Aji P.

The current study attempts to address this research question using a big data approach in a social media advertising context. Both attitude (i.e. clicking the “like” button for a company’s Facebook posts) and behavior (i.e. purchasing products from the company) are measured in a naturalistic setting. The goal is to examine whether Facebook “likes” on companies’ posts are significantly related to those companies’ revenue. The authors estimate panel models by using nearly eight years of data containing the S&P 500 companies’ Facebook activities in conjunction with their financial performance information. The results suggest that the number of Facebook “likes” is positively associated with revenue across the models. The study concludes with specific theoretical and practical implications and limitations. © 2024 Advertising Association.","attitude-behavior consistency; big data; facebook; Social media marketing; social media metrics","","","","","","","","Adam T., Goyal V.K., The investment opportunity set and its proxy variables, Journal of Financial Research, 31, 1, pp. 41-63, (2008); Aizer A., The gender wage gap and domestic violence, The American Economic Review, 100, 4, pp. 1847-1859, (2010); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research, Psychological Bulletin, 84, 5, pp. 888-918, (1977); Arellano M., Bond S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, The Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Arli D., Does social media matter?

Almost every business promotes itself through social media, and an educational institution is no different. The users’ responses to social media posts are crucial to a successful promotional campaign. An adverse reaction leaves a long-term negative impact on the audience, and the conversion rate falls. This is why selecting the content to share on social media is one of the most effective decisions behind the success of a campaign. This paper proposes a Data-Driven Promotional Management System (DPMS) for universities to guide the selection of appropriate content to promote on social media, which is more likely to obtain positive user reactions. The main objective of DPMS is to make effective decisions for Social Media Marketing (SMM). The novel DPMS uses a well-engineered and optimized BiLSTM network, classifying users’ sentiments about different university divisions, with a stunning accuracy of 98.66%. The average precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score of the DPMS are 98.12%, 98.24%, 99.39%, and 98.18%, respectively. This innovative Promotional Management System (PMS) increases the positive impression by 68.75%, reduces the adverse reaction by 31.25%, and increases the conversion rate by 18%. In a nutshell, the proposed DPMS is the first promotional management system for universities. It demonstrates significant potential for improving the brand value of universities and for increasing the intake rate. © 2023 by the authors.","BiLSTM network; data-driven decision; decision support system; deep learning; promotional management system; social media marketing","","","","","","Re-Engineering Enterprise Systems for Microservices; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP190100314); Australian Research Council, ARC","This work was supported in part by the Australian Research Council Discovery Project, Re-Engineering Enterprise Systems for Microservices in the Cloud, under Grant DP190100314.","Colombari R., Geuna A., Helper S., Martins R., Paolucci E., Ricci R., Seamans R., The interplay between data-driven decision-making and digitalization: A firm-level survey of the Italian and US automotive industries, Int.

In recent years, virtual influencers have gained popularity and given rise to falsity, or artificially created and manipulated influencers that are revolutionizing the field of influencer marketing. A virtual influencer is an entity—humanlike or not—that is autonomously controlled by artificial intelligence and visually presented as an interactive, real-time rendered being in a digital environment. As brands increasingly seek to engage virtual influencers to connect with and sell to audiences, we take a step back and discuss the opportunities and challenges they present for firms and managers. To help marketers understand this emerging field, we first document the rise of virtual influencers. Then, we discuss consumer reactions to virtual influencers before unpacking their associated opportunities and challenges for brands and marketers. Finally, we conclude with an overview of implications and future considerations. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Falsity; Influencer marketing; Social media marketing; Virtual influencers","","","","","","","","Araque J., Moynihan Q., A creepy virtual influencer looks so human, her skin changes with her surroundings, Business Insider, (2021); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for governments, businesses, and researchers to analyse users’ emotions and mental states in order to generate opinions and reviews about products, services, and daily activities. In the past years, several SA techniques based on Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and other soft computing approaches were proposed. However, growing data size, subjectivity, and diversity pose a significant challenge to enhancing the efficiency of existing techniques and incorporating current development trends, such as Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) and fusion techniques. With the aim of assisting the enthusiastic researcher to navigating the current trend, this article presents a comprehensive study of various literature to handle different aspects of SA, including current trends and techniques across multiple domains. In order to clarify the future prospects of MSA, this article also highlights open issues and research directions that lead to a number of unresolved challenges. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

E-commerce companies must develop a comprehensive customer-oriented marketing strategy based on big data and multi-channel to achieve their long-term healthy development. This paper first investigated the impact of the digital economy on e-commerce enterprises, focused on the transformation of the digital economy on the marketing model, expounded the development analysis of e-commerce in the digital economy era, and described the development trend of e-commerce marketing in the digital economy era. Then, this paper expounded the current problems faced by e-commerce enterprises, and discussed the lack of integrity, homogeneity, large-scale marketing strategies, and the lack of analysis and application of big data. After that, this paper put forward the marketing strategy of e-commerce enterprises in the digital economy era, and studied it from three aspects, namely, building a reasonable product management structure, marketing strategy based on customized marketing content, and social media marketing strategy based on information sharing. Then this paper proposed to use genetic algorithm to strengthen the marketing strategy of e-commerce enterprises. Finally, based on experiments and surveys, this paper used genetic algorithms to strengthen the construction of e-commerce enterprise marketing strategy in the digital economy, and concluded that the new e-commerce enterprise marketing strategy was 21% more satisfactory than the traditional new e-commerce enterprise marketing strategy. Through comparison, it can see that the integrity of the marketing plan of the new e-commerce enterprise's marketing strategy was 0.33 higher than that of the traditional e-commerce enterprise's marketing strategy, and the integrity of the promotion strategy was 0.34 higher than that of the traditional e-commerce enterprise's marketing strategy. After using the new e-commerce enterprise marketing strategy, the improved management structure was 0.29 higher than that of the traditional monitoring system, and the high quality of products was 0.18 higher than that of the traditional system. © 2024 The Authors","Digital economy; Electronic commerce; Enterprise marketing strategy; Genetic algorithm; Marketing mode","","","","","","Baicheng Normal University","This work was supported by Program for Innovative Research Team of Baicheng Normal University .

While the drivers and barriers to AI adoption have been extensively studied, there is a lack of scientific publications on AI adoption in digital marketing (DM) among Malaysian SMEs. This study examines how perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease-of-use (PEOU), and perceived barriers (PB) influence the intention to adopt AI in Malaysian SMEs. Data from 301 valid questionnaires were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) on SmartPLS 4.0. The results show that these factors explain 23 % of the variance in AI adoption intention. PU is the strongest driver, while PEOU has a weaker but significant effect. PB significantly hinders adoption, indicating the need to address technological, organizational, and market challenges. The weak but significant relationship between PU and PEOU suggests that businesses do not necessarily equate ease of use with usefulness, implying that AI solutions should be marketed based on their tangible business value rather than just user-friendliness. These findings provide practical guidance for businesses and policymakers aiming to promote AI adoption in the digital marketing sector. The research offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of AI for Malaysian SMEs, serving as a foundation for informed decision-making and strategic planning. © 2025 The Authors","AI adoption; Digital marketing; SME competitiveness; Social Media Marketing","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Hishamuddin Ismail is currently a Professor of Marketing at Faculty of Business, Multimedia University.

The aim of this study was to determine the social media behaviour of food retailers in Spain and the UK, and to identify significant changes pre and post-COVID-19 pandemic. The study analysed Twitter data collected from 16 food retailers; a total of 102,200 valid tweets were extracted from their official Twitter accounts. A term frequency analysis and a social network analysis of food retailers’ Twitter behaviour were carried out. The results obtained show differences for both UK and Spanish retailers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. For agri-food cooperatives with little bargaining power in the supply chain of fresh produce, data analysis is a key factor in improving their competitive positioning. These findings should be of value to data scientists as well as managers responsible for forming strategies in agri-food firms that have large food retailers as clients. Finally, the study also confirms that, for agri-food cooperatives, analysing tweet content is a cheap and useful tool for understanding customer behaviour. © 2023, CIRIEC-Espana Revista de Economia Publica, Social y Cooperativa.

The purpose of this paper is to identify and interpret the knowledge maps that emerge in social media research, based on deep learning algorithms and neural networks' impact in social content analytics. We conducted qualitative research, by analysing relevant articles focused on the role played by deep learning and neural networks in social media content analysis. The key themes retrieved from the selected articles have been included in visual representations, provided by Nvivo12 software, considering its text-mining capabilities. We are aware that large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) offers solutions for research issues on social media content analysis.

It solves the problem of consumer shopping choices on e-commerce websites and is currently a hot spot in the field of network information services. In this paper, from the perspective of the user's shopping process, we summarize the four factors that can maximally reflect the consumer's interest and preference, i.e., product browsing, collection, adding to cart, and purchasing behavior. To achieve static user interest weights, we quantify each index factor and set the corresponding rules. Considering the change in user interest, the decaying interest value over time is designed to compensate for the deficiencies of static system recommendations. We use implicit user feedback data to identify content that truly interests users and then construct a personalized recommendation algorithm for social media marketing content using multi-source data. The test results show that UIPR has an MRR value of more than 0.8 and an NDCG value of more than 0.55 in both the MovieLens and Taobao datasets, compared to the baseline model's best value. This proves that UIPR consistently performs better and makes better recommendations.  © 2024 Shitao Zhang et al., published by Sciendo.","Implicit feedback; Interest preferences; Multi-source data; Personalized recommendations; Social media","Implicit feedback; Interest preference; Multi-source data; Multi-Sources; Personalized recommendation; Personalized recommendation systems; Social media; Social media marketings; Source data; Users' interests","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE, (22YJA860006)","This article is the phased achievement of the Ministry of Education's humanities and social science program \""Public health crisis communication in the smart media era of public opinion risk management research\""(number: 22YJA860006).","Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Dwivedi Y.K., Algharabat R., Social media in marketing: A review and analysis of the existing literature, Telematics and informatics, 34, 7, pp. 1177-1190, (2017); Kapoor K.K., Tamilmani K., Rana N.P., Patil P., Dwivedi Y.K., Nerur S., Advances in social media research: Past, present and future, Information Systems Frontiers, 20, pp. 531-558, (2018); Szeto M.D., Mamo A., Afrin A., Militello M., Barber C., Social media in dermatology and an overview of popular social media platforms, Current dermatology reports, pp. 1-8, (2021); Tuten T.L., Social media marketing, (2023); Bawden D., Robinson L., Information overload: An introduction, Oxford research encyclopedia of politics, (2020); Fu C., Peng C., Liu X.Y., Yang L.T., Yang J., Han L., Search engine: The social relationship driving power of Internet of Things, Future Generation Computer Systems, 92, pp. 972-986, (2019); Mahdi M.N., Ahmad A.R., Ismail R., Subhi M.A., Abdulrazzaq M.M., Qassim Q.S., Information overload: The effects of large amounts of information, 2020 1st.

This study aims to describe the thematic structure of big data research in business, management, and accounting. Design/Methodology/Approach. A co-word analysis was performed on 12,345 documents retrieved from Scopus from 2014-2023 in the category “business, management, and accounting”. Modularity algorithms were used to identify themes and subthemes, and the clustering of terms was qualitatively analyzed. Results/Discussion. Five main themes were identified: (1) Business and economic data analysis, (2) big data analytics in marketing, consumer behavior, and employee dynamics, (3) Scalable machine learning and big data optimization, smart cities and urban development, (4) IoT-Driven innovations in industry 4.0 for optimized supply chain management, and (5) Social media and sentiment analysis in modern tourism and hospitality. The grouping of terms demonstrated the broad application of big data in healthcare, education, tourism, industry, organizational development, finance, social media, marketing, and hospitality. Conclusions. Big data is a field of application. This is evident in each cluster, where there are sub-themes that are nothing more than applying big data principles in sectors such as manufacturing, tourism services, education, health, and urbanization. Generally, the findings here are similar to other studies that have analyzed broader or more selective literature. © 2024 The author(s).","accounting; bibliometrics; big data; business; co-word analysis; management","","","","","","","","Agusti M.

Using a quantitative approach, data was collected from 322 participants who possess substantial knowledge of luxury perfume brands and are actively involved on social media platforms. The study employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the relationships among SMM, CBE, and CBBE constructs. Through thorough analysis, the study establishes significant positive correlations between CBE and CBBE, identifying cognition, emotion, and behavior as pivotal dimensions of CBE that contribute to the formation of CBBE. Furthermore, the research confirms the impact of various SMM dimensions—including entertainment, interaction, personalization, trendiness, and word of mouth—on CBBE components such as brand loyalty, perceived quality, and brand awareness/ associations. Additionally, it validates a direct link from SMM to CBE, where compelling content enhances consumer engagement. The study also verifies a sequential relationship from SMM to CBE and subsequently to CBBE. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, emphasizing the importance of comprehending and leveraging consumer engagement and SMM dynamics to bolster brand equity in the luxury perfume sector. The study identifies limitations and suggests future research directions to guide further investigation into these relationships. © 2024, Econjournals.

In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have played a pivotal role, particularly in digital promotions. The use of AI and ML in this area has garnered considerable attention from scholars; consequently, the relevant knowledge has rapidly evolved and became matured. Thus, the need to review and synthesize the role of AI and ML in digital promotion emerges to map the road for future scholars. However, such a need for a systematic review of AI and ML as a combined role in digital promotions is not yet comprehensive and completely addressed. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to consolidate existing knowledge on the use of AI and ML in digital promotions and to identify future research directions for scholars. After screening through the PRISMA approach, forty-two papers from the Scopus database were used for the SLR. The paper used Excel, R-Studio, and Biblioshiny to present a bibliometric review, The six main clusters were identified, namely, (i) social media marketing, (ii) personalization and targeting, (iii) advertising creative and content generation, (iv) optimizing customer interactions, (v) ethics and privacy concerns, and (vi) predictive analysis. Specific avenues and research questions are articulated under each cluster to guide future inquiries in this evolving area of study. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Digital marketing; Digital promotions; Machine learning (ML)","","","","","","","","Abrokwah-Larbi K., Awuku-Larbi Y., The impact of artificial intelligence in marketing on the performance of business organizations: Evidence from SMEs in an emerging economy, Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies, 16, 4, pp. 1090-1117, (2024); Akter S., Dwivedi Y.K., Sajib S., Biswas K., Bandara R.J., Michael K., Algorithmic bias in machine learning-based marketing models, Journal of Business Research, 144, pp. 201-216, (2022); Al Adwan A., Kokash H., Al Adwan R., Khattak A., Data analytics in digital marketing for tracking the effectiveness of campaigns and inform strategy, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 7, 2, pp. 563-574, (2023); Al Khaldy M.A., Al-Obaydi B.A.A., Al Shari A.J., The impact of predictive analytics and AI on digital marketing strategy and ROI, Conference on sustainability and cutting-edge business technologies, pp. 367-379, (2023); Albhirat M.M., Rashid A., Rasheed R., Rasool S., Zulkiffli S.N.A., Zia-ul-Haq H.M., The PRISMA statement in enviropreneurship study: A systematic literature and a research agenda, Cleaner Engineering and Technology, 18, (2024); Amin A., Anwar S., Adnan A., Nawaz M., Alawfi K., Hussain A., Huang K., Customer churn prediction in the telecommunication sector using a rough set approach, Neurocomputing, 237, pp. 242-254, (2017); Amin A., Shah B., Khattak A.M., Baker T., Anwar S., Just-in-time customer churn prediction: With and without data transformation, 2018 IEEE congress on evolutionary computation (CEC), pp. 1-6, (2018); Amin A., Shah B., Khattak A.M., Moreira F.J.L., Ali G., Rocha A., Anwar S., Cross-company customer churn prediction in telecommunication: A comparison of data transformation methods, International Journal of Information Management, 46, pp. 304-319, (2019); Amin A., Al-Obeidat F., Shah B., Adnan A., Loo J., Anwar S., Customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry under uncertain situation, Journal of Business Research, 94, pp. 290-301, (2019); Amin A., Adnan A., Anwar S., An adaptive learning approach for customer churn prediction in the telecommunication industry using evolutionary computation and Naïve Bayes, Applied Soft Computing, 137, (2023); Anantrasirichai N., Bull D., Artificial intelligence in the creative industries: A review, Artificial Intelligence Review, 1, pp. 589-656, (2022); Aria M., Cuccurullo C., Bibliometrix: An R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis, Journal of Informetrics, 11, 4, pp. 959-975, (2020); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology & Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Aung Y.Y.M., Wong D.C.S., Ting D.S.W., The promise of artificial intelligence: A review of the opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence in healthcare, British Medical Bulletin, 139, 1, pp. 4-15, (2021); Barnard J., Artz M., Search marketing in the age of AI: Understanding the marketing implications of search, assistive and answer engines, Journal of Digital and Social Media Marketing, 11, 3, pp. 244-260, (2023); Basu R., Aktar N., Kumar S., The interplay of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics in digital marketing and promotions: A review and research agenda, Journal of Marketing Analytics, (2024); Behera R.K., Bala P.K., Rana N.P., Algharabat R.S., Kumar K., Transforming customer engagement with artificial intelligence E-marketing: An E-retailer perspective in the era of retail 4.0, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 42, (2024); Blind K., Niebel C., Rammer C., The impact of the EU general data protection regulation on product innovation, Industry and Innovation, 31, 3, pp. 311-351, (2024); Broadhurst M., How businesses of any size can use AI in a digital marketing strategy, Applied Marketing Analytics, 8, 2, pp. 122-132, (2022); Cambria E., Grassi M., Hussain A., Havasi C., Sentic computing for social media marketing, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 59, pp. 557-577, (2012); Campbell C., Sands S., Ferraro C., Tsao H.Y.J., Mavrommatis A., From data to action: How marketers can leverage AI, Business Horizons, 63, 2, pp. 227-243, (2020); Chandra S., Shirish A., Srivastava S.C., To be or not to be …human?

Recently, the impact of COVID-19 on travel has severely disrupted this developing market, and heavily impacted travel influencers whose livelihood depends on collaboration with tourism, hospitality, and food businesses. This research presents the first “big data” evaluation of the induced transformations among the top Instagram travel influencers. The findings are based on computer image recognition of photographs published by 140 travel Instagrammers ranging from micro- to mega-influencers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the research proposes a methodology of identification of sponsored posts among travel influencers based on the fuzzy matching of post mentions and a global database of 6 million businesses. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Content analysis; COVID-19; Image recognition; Influencers; Instagram; Social media marketing","","","","","","","","Abidin C., Internet celebrity: understanding fame online, Eur J Commun, 33, 6, pp. 696-697, (2018); Abidin C., Lee J., Barbetta T., Miao W.S., Influencers and COVID-19: reviewing key issues in press coverage across Australia, China, Japan, and South Korea, Media Int Austral, (2020); Alon T., Doepke M., Olmstead-Rumsey J., Tertilt M., The impact of COVID-19 on gender equality, (2020); Top 150 top travel influencers in 2022 (Updated)., (2022); Annuziata M., The epicenter of influence—Amra and Elma, Forbes, (2020); Clearly Distinguishable Advertising Best Practice Guideline, (2017); Backhaus K., Erichson B., Plinke W., Weiber R., Multivariate analysemethoden, (2008); Barbe D., Neuburger L., Generation Z and digital influencers in the tourism industry, Generation Z marketing and management in tourism and hospitality, pp. 167-192, (2021); Boerman S.C., Helberger N., van Noort G., Hoofnagle C.J., Sponsored blog content: what do the regulations say?

The article provides a conceptual understanding of the elements of contemporary branding as they take place using networked platforms and explains them as an increasingly important practice that affects customer and manager experience. Design/methodology/approach: This article draws on a variety of recent sources to synthesize a model that offers a more contextualized, comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of how branding has become and is being altered because of the use of branded service platforms and algorithms. Findings: Core terminology about technoculture, technocultural fields, platform assemblages, affordances, algorithms and networks of desire set the foundation for a deeper conceptual understanding of the novel elements of algorithmic branding. Algorithmic branding transcended the mere attachment of specific “mythic” qualities to a product or experience and has morphed into the multidimensional process of using media to manage communication. The goal of marketers is now to use engagement practices as well as algorithmic activation, amplification, customization and connectivity to drive consumers deeper into the brand spiral, entangling them in networks of brand-related desire. Practical implications: The model has a range of important managerial implications for brand management and managerial relations. It promotes a understanding of platform brands as service brands. It underscores and models the interconnected role that consumers, devices and algorithms, as well as technology companies and their own service brands play in corporate branding efforts. It suggests that consumers might unduly trust these service platforms. It points to the growing importance of platforms' service brands and the consequent surrender of branding power to technology companies. And it also provides a range of important ethical and pragmatic questions that curious marketers, researchers and policy-makers may examine. Originality/value: This model provides a fresh look at the important topic of branding today, updating prior conceptions with a comprehensive and contextually grounded model of service platforms and algorithmic branding. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Branding; Brands; Consumer experience; Digital marketing; Marketing; Platform management; Platforms; Service platforms; Social media; Social media marketing","","","","","","","","Arvidsson A., Brands: Meaning and Value in Media Culture, (2006); Bergen M., Dutta S., Walker O.C., Agency relationships in marketing: a review of the implications and applications of agency and related theories, Journal of Marketing, 56, 3, pp. 1-24, (1992); Berry L.L., Cultivating service brand equity, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 128-137, (2000); Berthon P., Holbrook M.B., Hulbert J.M., Understanding and managing the brand space, MIT Sloan Management Review, 44, pp. 49-54, (2003); Brakus J.J., Schmitt B.H., Zarantonello L., Brand experience: what is it?

In recent years, automatic abstractive text summarization has attracted the attention of researchers because large volumes of digital text are readily available in multiple languages on a wide range of topics. Automatically generating precise summaries from large text has potential application in the generation of news headlines, a summary of research articles, the moral of the stories, media marketing, search engine optimization, financial research, social media marketing, question-answering systems, and chatbots. In literature, the problem of abstractive text summarization has been mainly investigated for English and some other languages. However, it has not been thoroughly explored for the Urdu language despite having a huge amount of data available in digital format. To fulfill this gap, this paper presents a large benchmark corpus of 2,067,784 Urdu news articles for the Urdu abstractive text summarization task. As a secondary contribution, we applied a range of deep learning (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, LSTM with attention, GRU, Bi-GRU, and GRU with attention), and large language models (BART and GPT-3.5) on our proposed corpus. Our extensive evaluation on 20,000 test instances showed that GRU with attention model outperforms the other models with ROUGE-1=46.7 , ROUGE-2=24.1 , and ROUGE-L =48.7.

However, little is known about how tourists use social media for travel planning and what factors influence their intentions to use social media for this purpose. This thesis aims to understand tourists’ intentions to use social media for travel planning. Specifically, it investigates the factors influencing tourists’ intentions to use social media for planning travel to Saudi Arabia. It develops a machine learning (ML) classification model to assist Saudi tourism SMEs in creating effective digital marketing strategies for social media platforms. A survey was conducted with 573 tourists interested in visiting Saudi Arabia, using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach. The findings support the tourist-based theoretical framework, showing that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), satisfaction (SAT), marketing-generated content (MGC), and user-generated content (UGC) significantly impact tourists’ intentions to use social media for travel planning. Tourists’ characteristics and visit characteristics influenced their intentions to use MGC but not UGC. The tourist-based ML classification model, developed using the LinearSVC algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 99% when evaluated using the K-Fold Cross-Validation (KF-CV) technique. The findings of this study have several implications for Saudi tourism SMEs. First, the results suggest that SMEs should focus on developing social media content that is perceived as useful, easy to use, and satisfying. Second, the findings suggest that SMEs should focus on using MGC in their social media marketing campaigns. Third, the results suggest that SMEs should tailor their social media marketing campaigns to the characteristics of their target tourists. This study contributes to the literature on tourism marketing and social media by providing a better understanding of how tourists use social media for travel planning. Saudi tourism SMEs can use the findings of this study to develop more effective digital marketing strategies for social media platforms. © 2023 by the authors.","digital marketing; machine learning; Saudi tourism; SMEs; travel planning","Commerce; E-learning; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Strategic planning; Tourism; Classification models; Digital marketing; Intention to use; Machine learning classification; Machine-learning; Saudi Arabia; Saudi tourism; SME; Social media; Travel planning; Marketing","","","","","","","Tourism Economic Impact: World Travel; Balsalobre-Lorente D., Abbas J., He C., Pilar L., Shah S.A.R., Tourism, urbanization and natural resources rents matter for environmental sustainability: The leading role of AI and ICT on sustainable development goals in the digital era, Resour.

An online questionnaire was used to collect data from 188 samples. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling approach, and the research hypotheses were examined using SEM. The study measured SMMAs through personalization, customer community, and live video. The results revealed that SMMAs were insignificant towards brand awareness and purchase intention. The result also stated that brand awareness does not mediate the relationship between SMMA and purchase intention. However, brand awareness was found to affect purchase intention positively. The current study introduces the stimulus–organism–response model as a theoretical support to examine SMMAs of e-commerce to customers' purchase intention via brand awareness.

We examined commercial JUUL-related messages on Instagram to identify marketing appeals used to target users along the continuum of e-cigarette use; we mapped the appeals to existing theoretical marketing frameworks to better understand industry strategies. Methods Hashtag-based keyword rules were used to collect JUUL-related posts from the Instagram application programming interface, 1 March–13 November 2018. Posts were classified as commercial or non-commercial. A combination of machine learning methods, keyword algorithms and human coding were used to characterise message themes in commercial posts. results Keyword filters captured 50 817 relevant posts and 41% were commercial. Among commercial posts, 91% contained recruitment/trial-based appeals (eg, combustible tobacco cessation; product sampling; giveaways) and 71% featured reinforcement/addiction-related appeals (eg, loyalty programmes). None of the commercial messages contained e-cigarette cessation-related appeals and less than 25% mentioned quitting combustible tobacco as a recruitment appeal. Conclusions Instagram posts featuring e-cigarette related marketing can increase exposure to persuasive messages encouraging e-cigarette trial and use particularly among susceptible youth. Stronger regulations are needed to prevent exposure to social media marketing among young social media users. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Analyzing the vast amount of data generated around a product, such as posts, comments, and views, can be challenging for business intelligence purposes. Sentiment analysis of this content helps both consumers and producers gain a better understanding of the market status, enabling them to make informed decisions. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on deep neural networks (DNNs) for sentiment analysis in product reviews, focusing on the classification of sentiments expressed. Our approach utilizes the recursive neural network (RNN) algorithm for sentiment classification. To address the imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples in social network data, we employ a resampling technique that balances the dataset by increasing samples from the minority class and decreasing samples from the majority class. We evaluate our approach using Amazon data, comprising four product categories: clothing, cars, luxury goods, and household appliances. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well in sentiment analysis for product reviews, particularly in the context of digital marketing. Furthermore, the attention-based RNN algorithm outperforms the baseline RNN by approximately 5%. Notably, the study reveals consumer sentiment variations across different products, particularly in relation to appearance and price aspects. © 2023 by University of Niš, Serbia.","Deep learning; Recursive neural network (RNN); Resampling technique; Social media marketing","Commerce; Deep neural networks; Domestic appliances; Marketing; Social networking (online); Business-intelligence; Deep learning; Learning approach; Neural networks algorithms; Product reviews; Recursive neural network; Recursive neural networks; Resampling technique; Sentiment analysis; Social media marketings; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Rout J.K., Choo K.K.R., Dash A.K., Bakshi S., Jena S.K., Williams K.L., A model for sentiment and emotion analysis of unstructured social media text, Electronic Commerce Research, 18, pp. 181-199, (2018); Liu H., Chatterjee I., Zhou M., Lu X.S., Abusorrah A., Aspect-based sentiment analysis: A survey of deep learning methods, IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems, 7, 6, pp. 1358-1375, (2020); Trueman T.E., Cambria E., A convolutional stacked bidirectional LSTM with a multiplicative attention mechanism for aspect category and sentiment detection, Cognitive Computation, 13, pp. 1423-1432, (2021); Sadr H., Pedram M.M., Teshnehlab M., A robust sentiment analysis method based on sequential combination of convolutional and recursive neural networks, Neural Processing Letters, 50, pp. 2745-2761, (2019); Silva N.F.F.D., Coletta L.F., Hruschka E.R., A survey and comparative study of tweet sentiment analysis via semi-supervised learning, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 49, 1, (2016); Dang N.C., Moreno-Garcia M.N., De la Prieta F., Sentiment analysis based on deep learning: A comparative study, Electronics, 9, 3, (2020); Rong W., Peng B., Ouyang Y., Li C., Xiong Z., Semi-supervised dual recurrent neural network for sentiment analysis, 2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, pp. 438-445, (2013); Evans D., Bratton S., McKee J., Social media marketing, (2021); Capatina A., Kachour M., Lichy J., Micu A., Micu A.E., Codignola F., Matching the future capabilities of an artificial intelligence-based software for social media marketing with potential users’ expectations, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 151, (2020); Mattila M., Salman H., Analysing social media marketing on twitter using sentiment analysis, (2018); Kitsios F., Kamariotou M., Karanikolas P., Grigoroudis E., Digital marketing platforms and customer satisfaction: Identifying eWOM using big data and text mining, Applied Sciences, 11, 17, (2021); Chen L.C., Lee C.M., Chen M.Y., Exploration of social media for sentiment analysis using deep learning, Soft Computing, 24, pp. 8187-8197, (2020); Umer M., Imtiaz Z., Ahmad M., Nappi M., Medaglia C., Choi G.

On social media, individuals can easily access others’ information, including videos, pictures, and locations, thereby enabling them to engage in social comparison anytime and anywhere. Compared to social comparison in direct communication, that on social media may have a deeper impact due to its characteristics of wider scope, selectivity, and suddenness. Previous research on the effects of social comparison on social media on individuals’ emotions has mostly focused on psychology. This study proposes that social comparison can alter consumers’ self-awareness and thinking patterns, leading to behavioral changes. However, there is a lack of research on social comparison in the marketing field, particularly on whether and how social comparison on social media influences consumer behavior. Therefore, this study investigates the interactive effects of social comparison and advertising appeals on consumers’ purchase intention as well as their potential mechanisms based on the “social comparison theory”, “impression management theory”, and “agentic-communal model” from a marketing perspective. Social comparison on social media includes upward and downward social comparisons. Upward comparison refers to when individuals compare their status to those of others who are more advantaged, leading to a decrease in self-perception and increase in self-enhancement motivation. Conversely, downward comparison refers to a scenario whereby individuals compare their status to those of the less fortunate, which may lead to a sense of superiority and increase in attention to interpersonal relationships. Previous research has found that individuals’ social cognition and evaluation of themselves and others typically involve the dimensions of warmth and competence. Therefore, this study explores the interactive effects of social comparison (upward vs. downward) and advertising appeals (competence vs. warmth) on consumers’ purchase intention, as well as the mediating role of information processing fluency. Two experiments are conducted on the Credamo platform to test the research hypotheses and model. Experiment 1 employs a 2 (social comparison: upward vs. downward) × 2 (advertising appeal: competence vs. warmth) between subjects design to investigate the interactive effects of social comparison and advertising appeal on consumers’ purchase intention. Results of the two-factor analysis of variance indicate a significant interaction effect between social comparison and advertising appeals on consumer purchase intention. Specifically, individuals who experience upward social comparison perceive a gap between themselves and others, which activates their personal agentic orientation and increases their attention toward achieving personal goals and accomplishments, thus leading to a willingness for self-enhancement. Ability appeal in advertising emphasizes not only the brand and product’s ability and efficiency but also the functional value it brings to consumers. Therefore, consumers are more inclined to prefer ability-oriented advertising appeals. Matching upward social comparison with ability-oriented advertising appeals increases consumer purchase intention. However, individuals who experience downward social comparison develop a sense of superiority, which activates their communal orientation and preference for social relationships, thereby increasing their attention to relational needs. The warmth appeal in advertising reflects the brand and product’s warmth and friendliness, emphasizing the emotional experience it brings to consumers. Matching downward social comparison with warmth-oriented advertising appeals increases consumers’ purchase intention. In Experiment 2, the same 2 (social comparison: upward vs. downward) × 2 (advertising appeal: competence vs. warmth) between-subjects design is adopted to investigate the mediating effect of information processing fluency. Mediation analysis is conducted using Model 8 in SPSS. Results show that information processing fluency plays a mediating role in the interaction effect of social comparison and advertising appeals on consumers’ purchase intention. Specifically, upward social comparison can stimulate consumers’ agentic orientation, activating their attention to certain concepts like ability, intelligence, efficiency, and self-enhancement, thereby making them more fluent vis-a-vis processing product functional information in ability-oriented advertising. By contrast, downward social comparison can activate consumers’ communal orientation, triggering their attention to concepts like trust, patience, friendliness, and sincerity. This makes them more fluent in processing product emotional information in warmth-oriented advertising. Information processing fluency can positively influence consumers’ attitudes and behavioral decisions, and higher information processing fluency can lead to higher purchase intention. This study investigates the influence of social comparison on consumer purchase intention from a marketing perspective, combining social comparison with advertising appeals, and revealing the internal mechanisms of their effects, thereby expanding the social comparison research field. Findings of the present study can provide theoretical inspiration and practical guidance for companies with regard to social media marketing. Companies should pay attention to the matching effect of social comparison situations and advertising appeals in social media marketing, or use big data to describe consumer portraits and provide precise personalized recommendations for different consumers to achieve better advertising effectiveness. © (2025), (Zhejiang University).

The sheer volume of data generated through social media can be overwhelming, but AI and ML can help organizations effectively manage this information to improve telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and the well-being of individuals and communities. Previous research has revealed several trends in AI–ML adoption: First, AI can be used to enhance social media marketing. Drawing on sentiment analysis and related tools, social media is an effective way to increase brand awareness and customer engagement. Second, social media can become a very useful data collection tool when integrated with new AI–ML technologies. Using this function well requires researchers and practitioners to protect users’ privacy carefully, such as through the deployment of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Third, AI–ML enables organizations to maintain a long-term relationship with stakeholders. Chatbots and related tools can increase users’ ability to receive personalized content. The review in this paper identifies research gaps in the literature. In view of these gaps, the paper proposes a conceptual framework that highlights essential components for better utilizing AI and ML. Additionally, it enables researchers and practitioners to better design social media platforms that minimize the spread of misinformation and address ethical concerns more readily. It also provides insights into the adoption of AI and ML in the context of remote patient monitoring and telehealth within social media platforms. © 2023 by the author.","AI; health organizations; ML; social media","","","","","","","","Leung R.C., Pasupathy K.S., The economics of social computing: Some preliminary findings on healthcare organizations, J.

Design/methodology/approach: A neural food aesthetic assessment model using computer vision and deep learning techniques is proposed, applied and evaluated on the food images data set. In addition, a set of photographic attributes drawn from food services and cognitive science research, including color, composition and figure–ground relationship attributes is implemented and compared with aesthetic scores for each food image. Findings: This study finds that restaurants with different rating levels, cuisine types and chain status have different aesthetic scores. Moreover, the authors study the difference in the aesthetic scores between two groups of image posters: customers and restaurant owners, showing that the latter group tends to post more aesthetically appealing food images about the restaurant on social media than the former. Practical implications: Restaurant owners may consider performing more proactive social media marketing strategies by posting high-quality food images. Likewise, social media platforms should incentivize their users to share high-quality food images. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide a novel methodological framework to assess the aesthetics of food images. Instead of relying on a multitude of standard attributes stemming from food photography, this method yields a unique one-take-all score, which is more straightforward to understand and more accessible to correlate with other target variables. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Computer vision; Deep learning; Food aesthetics; Gastronomic experience; Social media","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER007722, UID/ECO/00124/2019); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","The authors are very grateful to Mr Ben Collier who helped proof-read the paper, and to the editors and to the three peer-reviewers for their valuable comments that led to significant improvements of this paper.

AI can help identify the most popular hashtags for the industry and target audience. It can also help to create new and unique hashtags that will make the content stand out. A symbol or term containing the hash symbol (#), commonly known as a 'hashtag,' can be registered as a service trademark only if it serves as an identifier for the source of the applicant's goods or services. Successful registration of hashtag trademarks has occurred in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Under common law, business reputation, represented by a name or label, can only be safeguarded through a passing-off action, a process that is complex and uncertain in its outcome. The Trade Marks Act of 1999 provides trademark registration, conferring statutory rights to the owner that surpass common law rights and offering a convenient method for safeguarding against infringement. In the contemporary world, social media plays a crucial role in achieving business objectives such as brand awareness and customer acquisition. Social media platforms have become essential tools for marketing companies to connect with their target audience. Among these tools, the hashtag (#) has gained significant prominence and has been globally registered as a trademark by numerous companies in the current decade. There is widespread awareness among owners and entrepreneurs regarding the use of hashtags in social media campaigns and their registration as trademarks. Despite the increasing use of hashtags in India over the years, there remains a question about whether, according to Indian Trademark law, hashtags can be considered for registration. This paper delves into the importance of employing hashtags in India and examines their international usage. This paper examines the common law as well as trademark law remedies in India where the AI generated hashtag words are used in social media to boost search engines and e-marketing affecting the right of branded product owner. © 2025, National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research.

This research aims to analyze the specific digital marketing strategies affecting Gen-Z travellers’ decisions. Machine learning techniques were employed to uncover key insights. Data were collected through a survey using a convenience random sampling of 346 university students in Thailand. Correlation analysis and machine learning approaches, such as logistic regression and neural network analysis, were used to explore the relationships between various digital marketing strategies and their impact on Gen-Z travellers’ destination choices. The findings indicate that Online Travel Agency (OTA) websites exert the most significant influence on Gen-Z travellers’ decision-making processes, with an odds ratio of 1.6879. This is followed by the use of social media marketing strategies and businesses having their own websites. To validate these results, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique was also employed, confirming the importance of rankings derived from the logistic regression analysis. This research provides valuable insights into which digital marketing strategies most influence Gen-Z travellers’ decision-making processes. These insights can help tourism businesses make informed investments in digital marketing strategies, prioritizing those that align with the preferences of Gen-Z travellers. © 2024 Center for International Scientific Research of VSO and VSPP.

This study conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to map the intellectual evolution of this field, offering a longitudinal perspective across two periods: 2000–2021 and 2022–2024. Using SciMAT, the research identifies motor, transversal, emerging, and specialized themes, highlighting key topics such as recommender systems, anthropomorphism, natural language processing (NLP), and social media marketing. The findings reveal how foundational themes, like technology acceptance and user-generated content, have evolved into advanced applications focused on real-time personalization, consumer interaction, and automated decision-making. This work not only outlines the conceptual structure of AI in digital marketing but also identifies critical gaps and future research opportunities. Practical implications are provided for industry professionals, emphasizing strategies for leveraging AI-driven tools to enhance customer engagement, optimize campaigns, and foster trust. By mapping the progression of research themes, this study offers a roadmap for academics and practitioners aiming to navigate the dynamic landscape of AI in digital marketing. © (2024), (California State University).

Most extant research explores the marketing outcomes of using VIs in brand campaigns. However, little is known about how interacting with VIs on social media platforms may affect consumers' well-being. This research takes a comprehensive approach, developing a nuanced understanding of whether (and how) human-like VIs (HVIs) impact consumers' well-being. We employ a conceptual development approach drawing on scholarship from influencer marketing, narrative transportation, and consumer well-being and gather additional support for the conceptual framework from data collected by interviewing 25 followers of HVIs. The conceptual framework proposes that when interacting with influencers' social media posts, followers experience narrative transportation, which positively influences followers' hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. However, the conceptual framework also proposes that these relationships are moderated by the type of influencer (human vs. virtual) sharing the post. Specifically, we suggest that interactions with HVIs provide followers with enjoyment (hedonic well-being) and support their self-acceptance, personal growth, relationships, and autonomy (eudaimonic well-being). We also provide initial evidence of the favorable marketing outcomes of enhanced well-being from engagement with HVIs, including contemplation of brand purchase. The study thus advances extant VI literature by proposing a theoretically and empirically informed conceptual model that examines HVIs' influence on consumer well-being. Also, it contributes to addressing the broader calls for research on the impact of social media and influencer marketing on consumer well-being. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","consumer well-being; narrative transportation; social media influencers; social media marketing; virtual influencers","","","","","","","","Angmo P., Mahajan R., Virtual Influencer Marketing: A Study of Millennials and Gen Z Consumer Behaviour, Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 27, pp. 280-300, (2024); Ao L., Bansal R., Pruthi N., Khaskheli M.B., Impact of Social Media Influencers on Customer Engagement and Purchase Intention: A Meta-Analysis, Sustainability, 15, 3, (2023); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The Future of Social Media in Marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost Human?

His career started in the games industry, with roles such as Brand & Communications Director for FACEIT, the competitive gaming platform, and Head of Community Management for Jagex Games Studio. Strategic planning on social is starting to give way to another tactic — instinct. With AI integrated feeds dominating platforms like TikTok brands must adopt a more fluid approach to marketing. Success in this arena is based on pace, the right creatives and collaboration. The brands that can quickly identify emerging trends (by detecting ripples) leverage them (by riding waves) will reap the benefits long term (with the power of tides).

Consequently, this topic necessitates in-depth investigation to prepare for future changes. This study examines the role of AI in programmatic advertising through a quantitative content analysis of AI-enabled digital programmatic advertisements. Although the idea that sponsorship disclosure, appeals, and sentiments are important in persuasive messages has been documented, this study extends existing literature by examining these concepts within AI-enabled programmatic advertising. Sponsorship-linked marketing and congruence theory guided this study. The results showed that only about half of the ads revealed sponsorship information. Further, the brand-sponsor association was not clearly established in the ads. A sentiment analysis showed the prominence of positive sentiments in the ads. Additionally, the ads mostly used product- and consumer-focused appeals. Theoretical and research contributions and strategic marketing implications are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence; digital marketing; online advertising; programmatic advertising; search engine marketing; social media marketing; sponsorship disclosure","","","","","","","","Aackerman C.E., What are positive and negative emotions and do we need both?, Positivepsychology (blog), (2020); Abi K., Zakraoui S., Benahmed A., Artificial Intelligence (AI).

As consumer trust in social media influencers has declined, largely due to concerns about the financial motivations behind endorsements, AI tools such as ChatGPT have emerged as perceived neutral intermediaries. The research aims to understand whether AI systems can replace human influencers in shaping purchasing decisions and, if so, in which sectors. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving a quantitative survey of 478 participants with prior experience using both AI tools and interacting with social media influencers, complemented by 15 semi-structured interviews. The results reveal that AI is favoured over human influencers in product categories where objectivity and precision are critical, such as electronics and sporting goods, while human influencers remain influential in emotionally driven sectors like fashion and beauty. These findings suggest that the future of marketing will show a reduced need for human social media influencers and may involve a hybrid model where AI systems dominate data-driven recommendations and human influencers continue to foster emotional engagement. This shift has important implications for brands as they adapt to changing consumer trust dynamics. © 2025 by the author.","AI; AI tools; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; consumer behaviour; consumer trust; consumers; influencers; social media marketing","","","","","","","","Davenport T.H., Guha A., Grewal D., Bressgott T., How artificial intelligence will transform the future of marketing, J.

A survey of 423 consumers, analyzed using JASP software and advanced structural equation modeling (SEM), provides a data-driven lens into how credibility dimensions—experience, trustworthiness, attractiveness, and conformity—influence consumer perceptions and actions. Findings highlight the pivotal roles of experience and trustworthiness in fostering brand admiration, while attractiveness yields inconclusive results. Conformity emerges as a subtle yet significant factor in driving purchase intent. Notably, brand admiration serves as a critical intermediary, bridging the gap between influencer credibility and consumer purchase decisions. This research underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in decoding consumer behavior, offering fresh insights for marketers aiming to optimize influencer-driven campaigns in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

In social media marketing, sentiment analysis is one of the most popular research topics because it can be employed to perform brand or market research monitoring and to keep an eye on the competitors. Machine learning algorithms have been utilized to carry out the task. In addition, sentiment analysis is essential in cognitive computing. Currently, there are still a limited number of Thai sentiment analysis research. This paper proposes a framework for sentiment analysis in Thai along with Thai-SenticNet5 corpus. The framework employs different types of features, namely, word embedding, part-of-speech, sentic features, and all combinations of these features. Furthermore, we fused deep learning algorithms—convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)—in different ways and compare it to several other fused combinations. Three datasets in Thai were used in this work: ThaiTales, ThaiEconTwitter, and Wisesight datasets. The experimental results show that combining all three features and fusing deep learning algorithms were able to improve overall performance. The best hybrid deep learning was BLSTM-CNN that achieved F1-scores of 0.7436, 0.7707, and 0.5521, on ThaiTales, ThaiEconTwitter, and Wisesight datasets, respectively. According to the experimental results, we conclude that feature combination and hybrid deep learning algorithms can improve the overall performances. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning;

In this work, computational intelligence techniques are combined with common-sense computing and linguistics to analyze sentiment data flows, i.e., to automatically decode how humans express emotions and opinions via natural language. The increasing availability of social data is extremely beneficial for tasks such as branding, product positioning, corporate reputation management, and social media marketing. The elicitation of useful information from this huge amount of unstructured data, however, remains an open challenge. Although such data are easily accessible to humans, they are not suitable for automatic processing: machines are still unable to effectively and dynamically interpret the meaning associated with natural language text in very large, heterogeneous, noisy, and ambiguous environments such as the Web. We present a novel methodology that goes beyond mere word-level analysis of text and enables a more efficient transformation of unstructured social data into structured information, readily interpretable by machines. In particular, we describe a novel paradigm for real-time concept-level sentiment analysis that blends computational intelligence, linguistics, and common-sense computing in order to improve the accuracy of computationally expensive tasks such as polarity detection from big social data. The main novelty of the paper consists in an algorithm that assigns contextual polarity to concepts in text and flows this polarity through the dependency arcs in order to assign a final polarity label to each sentence. Analyzing how sentiment flows from concept to concept through dependency relations allows for a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept in text, to achieve a dynamic polarity inference that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods in terms of both accuracy and training time. © 2015 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Linguistics; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Automatic processing; Computational intelligence techniques; Corporate reputations; Dependency relation; Natural language text; Product positioning; Social media marketings; Structured information; Metadata","","","","","","","Cambria E., Hussain A., Havasi C., Eckl C., Common sense computing: From the society of mind to digital intuition and beyond, Biometric ID Management and Multimodal Communication, 5707, pp. 252-259, (2009); Cambria E., White B., Jumping NLP curves: A review of natural language processing research, IEEE Comput.

In this context, this study aims to discover and summarize the key optimisations regarding the creative ad components needed to run highly personalized ads based on a user profile. The participants were Facebook users between the ages of 18 and 65+ who were interested in dental services. Qualitative methods were adopted in order to discover suitable options for professionals to grow their business. In the first stage, the A/B split test using the Facebook Ads manager labelled the most effective creative component. In the second stage, an eye-tracking experiment generated 30 heatmaps that showed the differences between the segments. The results show solutions for attracting users by increasing the level of personalization of the ads. They are more beneficial for social media campaigns aimed at brand awareness targeting women and showing them a happy human face. When the target audience is men, technical details are preferred in order for the ad to become more attractive for them. This study enriches the literature and empowers professionals to deploy social media marketing growth strategies to attract users and make them convert to their full potential. © 2021 by the authors.","A/B split test; Business growth; Creative optimisation; Digital marketing for the dental industry; Eye tracking; Personalization; Social media marketing; User profile","","","","","","Transylvania University of Bras; Transylvania University of Brașov; European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (222954); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the Transylvania University of Bras,ov.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Transylvania University of Bra\u0219ov.","Chang Y.W., Hsu P.Y., Wang Y., Chang P.Y., Integration of online and offline health services: The role of doctor-patient online interaction, Patient Educ.

Electronic cigarettes have been heavily marketed across Twitter feeds, offering discounts, ""kid-friendly"" flavors, algorithmically generated false testimonials, and free samples. Methods All electronic cigarette keyword related tweets from a 10% sample of Twitter spanning January 2012 through December 2014 (approximately 850,000 total tweets) were identified and categorized as Automated or Organic by combining a keyword classification and a machine trained Human Detection algorithm. A sentiment analysis using Hedonometrics was performed on Organic tweets to quantify the change in consumer sentiments over time. Commercialized tweets were topically categorized with key phrasal pattern matching. Results The overwhelming majority (80%) of tweets were classified as automated or promotional in nature. The majority of these tweets were coded as commercialized (83.65% in 2013), up to 33% of which offered discounts or free samples and appeared on over a billion twitter feeds as impressions. The positivity of Organic (human) classified tweets has decreased over time (5.84 in 2013 to 5.77 in 2014) due to a relative increase in the negative words 'ban', 'tobacco', 'doesn't', 'drug', 'against', 'poison', 'tax' and a relative decrease in the positive words like 'haha', 'good', 'cool'. Automated tweets are more positive than organic (6.17 versus 5.84) due to a relative increase in the marketing words like 'best', 'win', 'buy', 'sale', 'health', 'discount' and a relative decrease in negative words like 'bad', 'hate', 'stupid', 'don't'. Conclusions Due to the youth presence on Twitter and the clinical uncertainty of the long term health complications of electronic cigarette consumption, the protection of public health warrants scrutiny and potential regulation of social media marketing. © 2016 Clark et al.

Through content, brands control, instigate and co-create value with its target audience. However, the nature of value propositions embedded within the cycle of content co-creation and their impact on eWOM outcomes has received scant attention from an empirical perspective. In this paper, we propose a value proposition-based framework around content marketing using established business perspectives. We employ bidirectional Twitter data from brands and customers to unearth descriptive, diagnostic and predictive insights into value propositions. Using a sample of marketer- and user-generated data from 10 Coffee (n(MGC) = 290, n(UGC) = 8811) and Car brands (n(MGC) = 635, n(UGC) = 7035) in 2018, a taxonomy of value propositions based on the literature was proposed and validated. The results of our study identify (a) descriptive insights explaining differentiation of brand value propositions, (b) diagnostic insights relating to consumer sentiments in response to the value proposition mix and (c) predictive insights of models predicting brand-specific values’ influencing Like, Share, Comment and Positive/Negative valence. Our results show that an effective social media marketing strategy selectively uses elements of the marketing mix (i.e. 4 P’s) within value propositions to attract favourable eWOM outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Brand communications; Customer engagement; eWOM outcomes; Marketer-generated content; Value propositions","Commerce; Predictive analytics; Social networking (online); Business perspective; Content marketings; Positive/negative; Social media marketings; Specific values; Target audience; User-generated; Value proposition; Marketing","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Building strong brands, (2012); Alboqami H., Al-Karaghouli W., Baeshen Y., Erkan I., Evans C., Ghoneim A., Electronic word of mouth in social media: the common characteristics of retweeted and favourited marketer-generated content posted on Twitter, Inderscience, 9, (2015); Ang S.H., Low S.Y., Exploring the dimensions of ad creativity, Psychol Mark, 17, 10, pp. 835-854, (2000); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: an exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychol Mark, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Bagozzi R.P., Gopinath M., Nyer P.U., The role of emotions in marketing, J Acad Mark Sci, 27, 2, pp. 184-206, (1999); Ballantyne D., Varey R.J., Creating value-in-use through marketing interaction: the exchange logic of relating, communicating and knowing, Mark Theory, 6, 3, pp. 335-348, (2006); Ballantyne D., Frow P., Varey R.J., Payne A., Value propositions as communication practice: taking a wider view, Ind Mark Manag, 40, 2, pp. 202-210, (2011); Beatty S.E., Kahle L.R., Homer P., Misra S., Alternative measurement approaches to consumer values: the list of values and the Rokeach value survey, Psychol Mark, 2, 3, pp. 181-200, (1985); Bharti K., Agrawal R., Sharma V., What drives the customer of world's largest market to participate in value co-creation?, Mark Intell Plan, 32, 4, pp. 413-435, (2014); Bolden R., Moscarola J., Bridging the quantitative–qualitative divide: the lexical approach to textual data analysis, Soc Sci Comput Rev, 18, 4, pp. 450-460, (2000); Brodie R.J., Hollebeek L.D., Juric B., Ilic A., Customer engagement: conceptual domain, fundamental propositions, and implications for research, J Serv Res, 14, 3, pp. 252-271, (2011); Brodie R.J., Saren M., Pels J., Theorizing about the service dominant logic: the bridging role of middle range theory, Mark Theory, 11, 1, pp. 75-91, (2011); Brown V.R., Vaughn E.D., The writing on the (Facebook) wall: the use of social networking sites in hiring decisions, J Bus Psychol, 26, 2, (2011); Chandler J.D., Lusch R.F., Service systems: a broadened framework and research agenda on value propositions, engagement, and service experience, J Serv Res, 18, 1, pp. 6-22, (2015); Cheung M.L., Pires G., Pj, Leung W.K., Chang M.K., The role of social media elements in driving co-creation and engagement, Asia Pac J Mark Log, (2021); Choi E., Ko E., Kim A.J., Explaining and predicting purchase intentions following luxury-fashion brand value co-creation encounters, J Bus Res, 69, 12, pp. 5827-5832, (2016); Choi E., Ko E., Kim A.J., Explaining and predicting purchase intentions following luxury-fashion brand value co-creation encounters, J Bus Res, 69, 12, pp. 5832-5927, (2016); Clarke I., Emerging value propositions for m-commerce, J Bus Strateg, 18, 2, (2001); Coelho R.L., de Oliveira D.S., de Almeida M.I., Does social media matter for post typology?

We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement—defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs—with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality—like humor and emotion—is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content—like mentions of price and deals—is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality–related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers’ path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook’s EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook’s behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality–related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodology we apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews. © 2018 INFORMS.","Advertising content; Consumer engagement; Content engineering; EdgeRank; Facebook; Machine learning; Marketing communication; Natural language processing; News Feed algorithm; Selection; Social media","Commerce; Digital storage; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Consumer engagement; Content engineering; EdgeRank; Facebook; Marketing communications; News feeds; Selection; Social media; Social networking (online)","","","","","Mack Institute of the Wharton School; Wharton Risk Center","History: Accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.

Choosing appropriate social media marketing strategies to stimulate customer engagement in different forms is an important issue. In order to better understand customer behaviours in the social media marketing context, we draw on the Stimulus-Organism-Response theory, and conceptualise and characterise marketing posts from six dimensions to get various features as stimuli, which induce or activate customers’ cognitive and affective states to varying levels, and ultimately lead to different behaviour responses. Machine learning algorithms are applied to the customer engagement behaviour choice prediction when facing marketing posts. It is proved that the post features designed by humans can be used to get good predictions, while the best results are achieved by combining the human-designed features with the high-dimensional features automatically extracted from post texts by the BERT model. Our research provides insights for firms to effectively conduct social media marketing design and customer engagement behaviour choice prediction. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","customer engagement behaviour; machine learning; neural network; Social media marketing","Commerce; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Predictive analytics; Sales; Social networking (online); Affective state; Customer behaviour; High dimensional feature; On-machines; Post features; Response theory; Social media marketings; Social media platforms; Machine learning","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (19JZD010)","This work was supported by Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research, Ministry of Education of China [grant number 19JZD010].","Adams K.M., Tweet upon a star: Organic brand engagement with celebrities on social media platforms, William & Mary Business Law Review, 8, 1, pp. 137-174, (2016); Alboqami H., Al-Karaghouli W., Baeshen Y., Erkan I., Evans C., Ghoneim A., Electronic word of mouth in social media: The common characteristics of retweeted and favourited marketer-generated content posted on twitter, International Journal of Internet Marketing and Advertising, 9, 4, pp. 338-358, (2015); Alhabash S., Almutairi N., Lou C., Kim W., Pathways to virality: Psychophysiological responses preceding likes, shares, comments, and status updates on Facebook, Media Psychology, 22, 2, pp. 196-216, (2019); Alhabash S., McAlister A.R., Redefining virality in less broad strokes: Predicting viral behavioral intentions from motivations and uses of Facebook and Twitter, New Media and Society, 17, 8, pp. 1317-1339, (2015); Antoniadis I., Paltsoglou S., Patoulidis V., Post popularity and reactions in retail brand pages on Facebook, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 47, 9, pp. 957-973, (2019); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology & Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Aydin G., Social media engagement and organic post effectiveness: A roadmap for increasing the effectiveness of social media use in hospitality industry, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, pp. 1-21, (2019); Barnes N.G., Mazzola A., Killeen M., Khalil N., (2020); Brodie R.J., Ilic A., Juric B., Hollebeek L., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Buhalis D., Mamalakis E., Social media return on investment and performance evaluation in the hotel industry context, In Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism, 2015, pp. 241-253, (2015); Chen Z., King B., Suntikul W., Festivalscapes and the visitor experience: An application of the stimulus organism response approach, International Journal of Tourism Research, May, pp. 1-14, (2019); Chernev A., Blair S., Doing well by doing good: The benevolent halo of corporate social responsibility, Journal of Consumer Research, 41, 6, pp. 1412-1425, (2015); Chu S.C., Kim Y., Determinants of consumer engagement in electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites, International Journal of Advertising, 30, 1, (2011); Chwialkowska A., The effectiveness of brand- and customer-centric content strategies at generating shares, “likes”, and comments, Journal of Promotion Management, 25, 2, pp. 270-300, (2019); Creevey D., Kidney E., Mehta G., From dreaming to believing: A review of consumer engagement behaviours with brands’ social media content across the holiday travel process, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 36, 6, pp. 679-691, (2019); Dessart L., Veloutsou C., Morgan-Thomas A., Capturing consumer engagement: Duality, dimensionality and measurement, Journal of Marketing Management, 32, 5-6, pp. 399-426, (2016); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., BERT: Pre-training of Ddeep Bbidirectional Ttransformers for Llanguage Uunderstanding, NAACL HLT 2019 - 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies - Proceedings of the Conference, 1, Mlm, pp. 4171-4186, (2018); De Vries L., Gensler S., Leeflang P.S.H., Popularity of brand posts on brand Fan pages: An investigation of the effects of social media marketing, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 26, 2, pp. 83-91, (2012); de Vries L., Peluso A.M., Romani S., Leeflang P.S.H., Marcati A., Explaining consumer brand-related activities on social media: An investigation of the different roles of self-expression and socializing motivations, Computers in Human Behavior, 75, pp. 272-282, (2017); Dobele A., Lindgreen A., Beverland M., Vanhamme J., van Wijk R., Why pass on viral messages?

Yet there is a lack of professional norms regarding the use of social media in marketing and a gap in understanding consumers’ comfort with marketers’ use of their social media data. This study analyzes a census-balanced sample of online adults (n = 751) to identify consumers’ perceptions of using social media data for marketing purposes. The research finds that consumers’ perceived risks and benefits of using social media have a relationship with their comfort with marketers using their publicly available social media data. The research extends the applicability of communication privacy management theory to social media and introduces marketing comfort—a new construct of high importance for future marketing research. Marketing comfort refers to an individual's comfort with the use of information posted publicly on social media for targeted advertising, customer relations, and opinion mining. In the context of the construct development, we find that targeted advertising is the strongest contributing component to marketing comfort, relative to the other two dimensions: opinion mining and customer relations. By understanding what drives consumer comfort with this emerging marketing practice, the research proposes strategies for marketers that can support and mitigate consumers’ concerns so that consumers can maintain trust in marketers’ digital practices. © 2019 The Authors","Consumer trust; Digital marketing; Ethics; Privacy; Social media","communication; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; ethics; information and communication technology; marketing; social media","","","","","Social Media Lab at Ryerson University; Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University; Ryerson University; Canada Research Chairs","Funding text 1: This research is supported in part through a five-year initiative on “Social Media Data Stewardship” funded by the Canada Research Chairs program (2015–2020; Principal Investigator: Gruzd, A.), eCampusOntario research funding and the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University.

On the other hand, opinion mining in social media is nowadays an important parameter of social media marketing. Digital media giants such as Google and Facebook developed and employed their own tools for that purpose. These tools are based on publicly available software libraries and tools such as Word2Vec (or Doc2Vec) and fasttext, which emphasize topic modeling and extract low-level features using deep learning approaches. So far, researchers have focused their efforts on opinion mining and especially on sentiment analysis of tweets. This trend reflects the availability of the Twitter API that simplifies automatic data (tweet) collection and testing of the proposed algorithms in real situations. However, if we are really interested in realistic opinion mining we should consider mining opinions from social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, which are far more popular among everyday people. The basic purpose of this paper is to compare various kinds of low-level features, including those extracted through deep learning, as in fasttext and Doc2Vec, and keywords suggested by the crowd, called crowd lexicon herein, through a crowdsourcing platform. The application target is sentiment analysis of tweets and Facebook comments on commercial products. We also compare several machine learning methods for the creation of sentiment analysis models and conclude that, even in the era of big data, allowing people to annotate (a small portion of) data would allow effective artificial intelligence tools to be developed using the learning by example paradigm. © 2019 Tsapatsoulis and Djouvas.","Collective intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social media messages","","","","","","Cyprus University of Technology, CUT","This work was supported by Cyprus University of Technology Open Access Author Fund.","Agarwal A., Xie B., Vovsha I., Rambow O., Passonneau R., Sentiment analysis of twitter data,, Proceedings of the Workshop on Languages in Social Media, LSM'11, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 30-38, (2011); Aizawa A., An information-theoretic perspective of tf-idf measures, Inform.

Public figures and brands have to be very careful about what they post online. That is why the need for accurate strategies for anticipating the impact of a post written for an online audience is critical to any public brand. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to predict the impact of a given post by accounting for the content, style, and behavioral attributes as well as metadata information. For validating our method we collected Facebook posts from 10 public pages, we performed experiments with almost 14000 posts and found that the content and the behavioral attributes from posts provide relevant information to our prediction model.  © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Ltd, Indore, India; Department of Marketing, Management Development Institute, Gurgaon, India","Senecha N., Department of Marketing, Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd, Indore, India; Srivastava R., Department of Marketing, Management Development Institute, Gurgaon, India","Learning outcomes: After studying and analyzing this case, students will be able to: understand and evaluate the integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategy for online businesses; understand and create the various components of an IMC plan; determine the challenges of scaling up a business and how social media marketing can help in that; learn how to assemble the positioning statement of a startup; determine and differentiate the different business models (revenue models); and understand and create the social media marketing strategy. Case overview/synopsis: It was late April 2021, and Mr Srinivas Rao, the co-founder and director of Mentorrd EduTech, India, was contemplating the journey of more than five years. Much had changed since the startup Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Mentorrd EduTech) was launched in 2015. From being an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for analyzing and building resumes, Mentorrd expanded to specialized premium services for career development catering to MBA aspirants from India to international markets. However, during the same time, many problems had also started showing up. The competition had increased, and conversions became difficult. Mentorrd generated 95% of its leads through Google Ads pay per click (PPC) advertising. However, now, the increased competition made PPC costlier, where Mentorrd started at INR 10 per click but was now paying INR 50 per click. The customers also were only limited to searching for keywords; hence, actual lead conversion was minimal. Mentorrd was present on different social media platforms and had developed an audience: LinkedIn (close to 10,000 followers), Facebook (1,600+ followers) and Twitter (numbers), but conversions from there were only contributing to 5% of the total revenue.Mr Rao wondered that with a change in demand from general review services to specialist resume and interview preparation services such as MBA, he would have to develop a sound social media strategy integrated with the current Google Ads usage to reach the audience and generate conversions. He had a limited marketing budget which he wanted to use most effectively but was not sure how to spend across platforms. Complexity academic level: This case can be used as an IMC strategy case for MBA courses in marketing. In a marketing course, the focus should be on components of IMC strategy, customer perception, company positioning and marketing channels. The case can also be applied as a strategy case for courses in entrepreneurship or digital marketing strategy. In an entrepreneurship course, the focus should be on the business model, growth and scaling decisions a startup needs to make to grow the business. In a digital marketing strategy course, the focus should be on social media marketing and search engine marketing decisions and the implications for revenues and profits. The case can also be used in executive-level courses to illustrate IMC, growth and digital marketing strategies for a startup.

Although an extensive amount of research has been developed in B2C and B2B marketing context, few social media studies take a dive into potential linkages between external and internal marketing contexts in an industry specific paradigm. This study aims to bridge B2C and B2B social media marketing, by adopting the outside-in perspective as theoretical lens. Using a large-scale dataset, collected from a micro-blogging site, and consumer-oriented information assembled from multiple sources, we empirically examine the inter-relationship between firm-generated messages, consumer digital engagement, and firm sales performance in the movie industry. Theoretically, this study builds upon the outside-in perspective and extends the current knowledge of the outside-in perspective to the social media context. It also bridges the B2C and B2B marketing literature by demonstrating that the insight garnered from B2C social media interactions should be integrated into the B2B firm interactions, communications, and decision makings. Managerially, this study provides movie practitioners with important implications. © 2021","Big data analysis; Consumer digital engagement; Firm-generated content; Outside-in perspective; Social media","","","","","","Solutions for Aging Societies, (GZ 1570); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (91546121); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number: 91546121 ] and Digital Transformation in China and Germany: Strategies, Structures and Solutions for Aging Societies [grant number: GZ 1570 ].","Agnihotri R., Dingus R., Hu M.Y., Krush M.T., Social media: Influencing custome satisfaction in B2B sales, Industrial Marketing Management, 53, pp. 172-180, (2016); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akpinar E., Berger J., Valuable virality, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 318-330, (2017); Alhabash S., McAlister A.R., Redefining virality in less broad strokes: Predicting viral behavioral intentions from motivations and uses of Facebook and twitter, New Media & Society, 17, 8, pp. 1317-1339, (2014); Alhabash S., McAlister A.R., Quilliam E.T., Richards J.I., Lou C., Alcohol's getting a bit more social: When alcohol marketing messages on Facebook increase young adults’ intentions to imbibe, Mass Communication and Society, 18, 3, pp. 350-375, (2015); Armstrong J.S., Persuasive advertising: Evidence-based principles, (2010); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology and Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Berger J., Schwartz E.M., What drives immediate and ongoing word of mouth?, Journal of Marketing Research, 48, 5, pp. 869-880, (2011); Bill F., Feurer S., Klarmann M., Salesperson social media use in business-to-business relationships: An empirical test of an integrative framework linking antecedents and consequences, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 4, pp. 734-752, (2020); Brennen R., Croft R., The use of social media in B2B marketing and branding: An exploratory study, Journal of Customer Behaviour, 11, 2, pp. 101-115, (2012); Calder B.J., Isaac M.S., Malthouse E.C., Taking the customer's point-of-view: Engagement or satisfaction?, (2013); Calder B.J., Malthouse E.C., Schaedel U., An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 23, 4, pp. 321-331, (2009); Cameron A.C., Trivedi P.K., Count panel data, (2013); Cao D., Meadows M., Wong D., Xia S., Understanding consumers' social media engagement behaviour: An examination of the moderation effect of social media context, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 835-846, (2021); Chen K., Yin J., Information competition in product launch: Evidence from the movie industry, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 26, pp. 81-88, (2017); Chen Z., Berger J., When, why, and how controversy causes conversation, Journal of Consumer Research, 40, 3, pp. 580-593, (2013); Chevalier J.A., Mayzlin D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 3, pp. 345-354, (2006); Choudhary V., Currim I., Dewan S., Jeliazkow I., Mintz O., Turner J., Evaluation set size and purchase: Evidence from a product search engine, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 37, pp. 16-31, (2017); Colicev A., Kumar A., O'Connor P., Modeling the relationship between firm and user generated content and the stages of the marketing funnel, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 36, 1, pp. 100-116, (2019); Colicev A., Malshe A., Pauwels K., O'Connor P., Improving consumer mindset metrics and shareholder value through social media: The different roles of owned and eared media, Journal of Marketing, 82, 1, pp. 37-56, (2018); Cortez R.M., Johnston W.J., The future of B2B marketing theory: A historical and prospective analysis, Industrial Marketing Management, 66, pp. 90-102, (2017); Coulter K.S., Punj G.N., The effects of cognitive resource requirements, availability, and argument quality on brand attitudes: A melding of elaboration likelihood and cognitive resource matching theories, Journal of Advertising, 33, 4, pp. 53-64, (2004); Coursaris C.K., Van Osch W., Balogh B.A., Informing brand messaging strategies via social media analytics, Online Information Review, 40, 1, pp. 6-24, (2016); Darke P.R., Ritchie R.J.B., The defensive consumer: Advertising deception, defensive processing, and distrust, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 1, pp. 114-127, (2007); Das G., Wiener H.J., Kareklas I., To emoji or not to emoji?

This paper focuses on a specific kind of reviews: the suggestive type. Suggestions have a significant influence on both consumers' choices and designers' understanding and, hence, they are key for tasks such as brand positioning and social media marketing. The proposed approach consists of three main steps: (1) classify comparative and suggestive sentences; (2) categorize suggestive sentences into different types, either explicit or implicit locutions; (3) perform sentiment analysis on the classified reviews. A range of supervised machine learning approaches and feature sets are evaluated to tackle the problem of suggestive opinion mining. Experimental results for all three tasks are obtained on a dataset of mobile phone reviews and demonstrate that extending a bag-of-words representation with suggestive and comparative patterns is ideal for distinguishing suggestive sentences. In particular, it is observed that classifying suggestive sentences into implicit and explicit locutions works best when using a mixed sequential rule feature representation. Sentiment analysis achieves maximum performance when employing additional preprocessing in the form of negation handling and target masking, combined with sentiment lexicons. © 2014 Atika Qazi et al.","","Artificial Intelligence; Consumer Behavior; Marketing; Questionnaires; Suggestion; article; book; business intelligence; commercial phenomena; consumer; data mining; learning algorithm; linguistics; machine learning; mobile phone; social marketing; social media; support vector machine; artificial intelligence; consumer attitude; marketing; procedures; questionnaire; suggestion","","","","","","","Thet T.T., Na J.-C., Khoo C.S.G., Aspect-based sentiment analysis of movie reviews on discussion boards, Journal of Information Science, 36, 6, pp. 823-848, (2010); Cambria E., White B., Jumping NLP curves: A review of natural language processing research, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 9, 2, pp. 48-57, (2014); Pang B., Lee L., Vaithyanathan S., Thumbs up?

The study involved the comparisons of consumer preference for different marketing attributes by placing them on a comparable pricing scale, or pricing out non-monetary stimuli (e.g., ordering type, shipping, size, pictures, donation to charity, and guarantee). The research framework adopted was the Behavioral Perspective Model of consumer choice. The results of the conjoint study (Pearson's R=0.998, p<0.05) showed an inverse relation between price and utility, with higher prices corresponding to lower utility. This inverse relationship for utility also holds true for other attributes, such as shipping cost. In line with behavior analytical focus on individualization and increasing emphasis on personalized marketing, we show partial utility scores from different consumers based on altered interventions for decision-making with scenario testing and a demand curve. We discuss the implications of conjoint analysis as an experimental survey technique for decision-making in managerial economics and its role as an efficient pre-testing for more direct measures on behavior in online experimental analysis of behavior. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Allison J., Economics and operant conditioning, Advances in Analysis of Behavior: Vol. 2: Predictability, Correlation, and Contiguity, pp. 321-353, (1981); Bickel W.K., Green L., Vuchinich R.E., Behavioral economics, Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 64, pp. 257-262, (1995); DiClemente D.F., Hantula D.A., Optimal foraging online: increasing sensitivity to delay, Psychology and Marketing, 20, pp. 785-810, (2003); Fagerstrom A., The motivating effect of antecedent stimuli on the web shop: a conjoint analysis of the impact of antecedent stimuli at the point of online purchase, Journal of Organizational Behavior Management, 30, pp. 199-220, (2010); Fagerstrom A., Ghinea G., On the motivating impact of price and online recommendations at the point of online purchase, International Journal of Information Management, 31, pp. 103-110, (2011); Fagerstrom A., Arntzen E., Foxall G.R., A study of preferences in a simulated online shopping experiment, The Service Industries Journal, 31, pp. 2603-2615, (2011); Foxall G.R., Radical behaviorist interpretation: generating and evaluating an account of consumer behavior, The Behavior Analyst, 21, pp. 321-354, (1998); Foxall G.R., Foundations of consumer behavior analysis, Marketing Theory, 1, pp. 165-199, (2001); Foxall G.R., Consumer Behavior Analysis: Critical Perspectives in Business and Management, (2002); Foxall G.R., The behavior analysis of consumer choice, Journal of Economic Psychology, 24, pp. 581-588, (2003); Foxall G.R., Explaining Consumer Choice, (2007); Foxall G.R., Interpreting Consumer Choice: The Behavioral Perspective Model, (2010); Foxall G.R., Oliveira-Castro J.M., Schrezenmaier T.C., The behavioral economics of consumer brand choice: patterns of reinforcement and utility maximization, Behavioral Processes, 66, pp. 235-260, (2004); Gaur V., Fisher M.L., In-store experiments to determine the impact of price on sales, Production and Operations Management, 14, pp. 377-387, (2005); Green P.E., On the design of choice experiments involving multifactor alternatives, Journal of Consumer Research, 1, pp. 61-68, (1974); Green P.E., Rao V.R., Conjoint measurement for quantifying judgmental data, Journal of Marketing Research, 8, pp. 355-363, (1971); Green P.E., Srinivasan V., Conjoint analysis in consumer research: issues and outlook, Journal of Consumer Research, 5, pp. 1023-1033, (1978); Green P.E., Srinivasan V., Conjoint analysis in marketing research: new developments and directions, Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 3-19, (1990); Green P.E., Krieger A.M., Wind Y., Thirty years of conjoint analysis: reflections and prospects, Interfaces, 31, pp. S56-S73, (2001); Gustafsson A., Herrman A., Huber F., Conjoint Measurement.

The proliferation of gambling advertising on Twitter is one such challenge. However, the sheer scale renders it extremely difficult to investigate using conventional techniques. In this article, the authors present three U.K. Twitter gambling advertising studies using both big data analytics and manual content analysis to explore the volume and content of gambling ads, the age and engagement of followers, and compliance with U.K. advertising regulations. They analyze 890,000 organic ads from 417 accounts along with data on 620,000 followers and 457,000 engagements (replies and retweets). They find that approximately 41,000 U.K. children follow Twitter gambling accounts, and that two-thirds of gambling advertising tweets fail to fully comply with regulations. Ads for e-sports gambling are markedly different from those for traditional gambling (such as on soccer, casinos, and lotteries) and appear to have strong appeal for children, with 28% of engagements with e-sports gambling ads coming from users under 16 years old. The authors make six policy recommendations: spotlight e-sports gambling advertising, create new social media–specific regulations, revise regulation on content appealing to children, use technology to block users under 18 years from seeing gambling ads, require ad labeling of organic gambling tweets, and deploy better enforcement. © The Author(s) 2021.","big data analytics; e-sports; gambling advertising; online betting; social media marketing","","","","","","RGSB; RSGB; Responsible Gambling Strategy Board; University of Edinburgh, ED; GambleAware","Funding text 1: The authors thank Nathan Critchlow (University of Stirling) and Fiona Dobbie (University of Edinburgh) for their invaluable work and advice on the content analysis codebook.

Predicting start-up firms’ social media engagement level can allow them to gauge the effectiveness of their social media marketing efforts and can provide numerous benefits related to strategic marketing processes. This study focuses on developing a methodology involving data science processes and machine learning models to account for the ongoing advancement of business intelligence methodologies. This study gathered data of 8,434 start-up firms from Twitter, generated social media-based features, and created machine learning models to predict the social media engagement level of each firm. The results show that deep learning provides the best accuracy in predicting the engagement levels. The results also show that the number of tweets by the firms, the number of retweets received, and the number of likes received have the most significance in determining the effectiveness of social media marketing activities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data analysis; Machine learning; Marketing; Social media; Start-ups","Commerce; Data Science; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Learning systems; Marketing; Analytical methodology; Engagement levels; Low costs; Machine learning models; Social media; Social media marketings; Strategic marketing; business development; data processing; machine learning; market conditions; marketing; prediction; social media; Social networking (online)","","","","","Kwangwoon University, KW University, (2017-0-00096)","This work was supported by Kwangwoon University, South Korea and by the MISP Korea , under the National Program for Excellence in SW (2017-0-00096) supervised by IITP.

While considerable research has explored text-based user-generated content on social media, research on photos is still in its early stages. This paper uses a sample of 44,765 Facebook photos from 503 Facebook users in the United States and Germany to determine the degree to which photos play an integral role in people's social media communications. The analysis shows that uploading brand photos (i.e., photos containing a brand name or logo) is related to brand love, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth (WOM) endorsement of the brand in question. We then code a subsample of these photos for content and train a powerful hybrid machine learning algorithm combining genetic search and artificial neural networks. The resulting algorithm is able to predict users' brand love, brand loyalty, and WOM endorsement from the content of their brand photos posted on Facebook. Finally, we discuss the implications for social media marketing, in particular social media monitoring. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","AI; Artificial intelligence; Brand love; Machine learning; Monitoring; Social media; User-generated content","","","","","","NIM; Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions","Funding for this project was provided by NIM - Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions (formerly GfK Verein) .

The results show that cognitive, structural, and relational dimensions of social capital sources served as predictors of fundraising for start-ups. Specifically, shared values (e.g., the number of followers, the number of investors of start-up companies) and attention (e.g., product/service descriptions and videos), which account for the cognitive dimension, positively led to the increased amount of investor funding. Trust (e.g., the quality rating, the number of rounds of funding, and the number of investors) as the subconstruct of the relational dimension was a determinant of fundraising. Social interaction ties (e.g., the number of likes, the number of social media followers) were found to increase the amount of funding as an aspect of the structural dimension. The results of a further analysis demonstrate a process of social capital formation by examining the effect of social interaction ties on the amount of funding mediated by shared values and trust. The current study contributes to extend knowledge on the start-up communication aligned with a resource-driven view of strategy. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cancer immunity; crowdfunding; polarization;

Despite the rapid methodological advances, how to obtain scalable estimators with free tuning of the regularization parameters remains unclear under general noise covariance structures. In this article, we develop a new methodology called sequential scaled sparse factor regression (SESS) based on a new viewpoint that the problem of recovering a jointly low-rank and sparse regression coefficient matrix can be decomposed into several univariate response sparse regressions through regular eigenvalue decomposition. It combines the strengths of sequential estimation and scaled sparse regression, thus sharing the scalability and the tuning free property for sparsity parameters inherited from the two approaches. The stepwise convex formulation, sequential factor regression framework, and tuning insensitiveness make SESS highly scalable for big data applications. Comprehensive theoretical justifications with new insights into high-dimensional multi-response regressions are also provided. We demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed method by simulation studies and stock short interest data analysis. © 2020 American Statistical Association.","Big data; Latent factors; Scalability; Sparse reduced-rank regression; Stock short interest analysis; Tuning insensitiveness","","","","","","Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation-1708085QA02; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities-WK2040000027, (WK2040160028); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11601501, 11671374, 71731010, 71921001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province","Funding text 1: Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province; ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China-72071187, 11601501, 11671374, 71731010, and 71921001, Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation-1708085QA02, and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities-WK2040000027, WK2040160028.

To acquire continuous revenues and more active customers, key business players should understand the behaviour and purchase preferences of buyers. To predict the buying decisions of purchasers, data about purchase intentions and desires have to be extracted with the help of data mining techniques. The purpose of this paper is to examine social media data analytics using machine learning tools; this new approach for developing a social media marketing strategy employs the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). WEKA is compared with other algorithms of interest and found to outperform its peers, especially with regard to parameters such as precision, recall, and F-measure, indicating that WEKA performs better than other approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Information sciences; Machine learning and WEKA; Social analytics; Social media marketing","Commerce; Data Analytics; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Sales; Social networking (online); Buying decisions; F measure; Knowledge analysis; New approaches; Purchase intention; Social media; Social media datum; Social media marketings; Data mining","","","","","","","Weber L., Marketing to the Social Web: How digital Customer Communities Build your Business, (2009); Tapscott D., Williams A.D., Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, (2008); Drummond W.J., French S.P., The future of GIS in planning: converging technologies and diverging interests, J.

However, how to maximize the value of the overall marketing budget is one of the most concerning issues of all enterprises. The content of the Facebook photo post needs to be analyzed effectively so that the social media companies and managers can concentrate on handling their fan pages. This research aimed to use text mining techniques to find the audience accurately. Therefore, we built a topic model recommendation system (TMRS) to analyze Facebook posts by sorting the target posts according to the recommended scores. The TMRS includes six stages, such as data preprocessing, Chinese word segmentation, word refinement, TF-IDF word vector conversion, creating model via Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and calculating the recommendation score. In addition to automatically selecting posts to create advertisements, this model is more effective in using marketing budgets and getting more engagements. Based on the recommendation results, it is verified that the TMRS can increase the engagement rate compared to the traditional engagement rate recommended method (ERRM). Ultimately, advertisers can have the chance to create ads for the post with potentially high engagements under a limited budget. © 2020 by the authors.","Facebook advertising post; Post engagement; Recommendation system; Social media marketing; Text mining; Topic model","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (108-2511-H-009 -009 -MY3)","Funding: This research was partially supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under the grant no. 108-2511-H-009 -009 -MY3.","Lu J., Wu D., Mao M., Wang W., Zhang G., Recommender system application developments: A survey, Decis.

Existing methods mainly focus on text information but overlook other types of data. In light of the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM), in this study, we argue that it is valuable to consider users’ social connections in addition to postings for identifying product adoption intentions. Based on this rationale, we propose a novel multiview deep learning framework to identify product adoption intentions. Extensive experiments show our proposed approach is effective, and demonstrate the benefit of incorporating social network information for intention identification. © 2021","Deep learning; Multi-view learning; Product adoption intention; Text mining","Behavioral research; Marketing; Social networking (online); Behavioral model; Business practices; Learning frameworks; Multi-view learning; Social connection; Social media marketings; Social network informations; Text information; Deep learning","","","","","Longhua District Science and Technology Innovation Fund, (10162a20200617b70da63); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1228509); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71621002, 71902179, 71974187, 72074209); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2019QY(Y)0101, 2020AAA0103405, 2020AAA0108401)","We thank Dr. Xin Li for his help in reviewing and revising the manuscript.

Furthermore, it studies the effect of consumers’ attitudes towards these advertisements on the development of their attitudes towards brands. An online questionnaire was used to collect data from 412 Instagram users in Egypt. The results suggest that the level of consumers’ perception of informativeness, entertainment, credibility and lack of irritation in the Instagram advertisements is strongly related to their attitudes. Moreover, the results confirm the positive effect of consumers’ attitudes towards Instagram advertisements on their attitudes towards the advertised brands. The current study contributes theoretically by presenting the factors that can make consumers hold favourable attitudes towards advertising on their Instagram accounts.

This study is an SBI-driven analysis of a company operating in the insurance sector. It underlines the contribution of SBI technology to sustainable profitability of a company by using an optimized marketing campaign on Facebook, in symmetry with a traditional e-mail campaign. Starting from a campaign on SM, the study identified a client portfolio, processed data, and applied a set of statistical methods, such as the index and the statistical significance (T-test), which later enabled the authors to validate research hypotheses (RH), and led to relevant business decisions. The study outlines the preferences of the selected group of companies for the manner in which they run a marketing campaign on SM in symmetry with an e-mail-run campaign. Although the study focused on the practical field of insurance, the suggested model can be used by any company of any industry proving that BI technologies is the nexus of collecting and interpreting results that are essential, globally applicable, and lead to sustainable development of companies operating in the age of globalization. The results of the study prove that symmetrical unfolding (time and opportunity symmetry) of SM marketing campaigns, and using email, could lead to better results compared to two separate marketing campaigns. Moreover, the outcomes of both campaigns showed convergence on SBI platforms, which led to higher efficiency of management of preferences of campaign beneficiaries in the insurance sector. © 2020 by the authors.

Additionally, ad intrusiveness was studied as a mediator of the relationship between ad–media congruence and consumers’ behavioral engagement intention. Design/methodology/approach: An online 2 (Ad appeal: hedonic vs utilitarian) × 2 (Brand type: hedonic vs utilitarian) between-subject experiment was conducted with four versions of mock-up Instagram in-feed native ads. Findings: Results showed that hedonic advertising appeals contributed to ad–media congruence on Instagram, which yielded a lower level of ad intrusiveness and further resulted in higher consumer behavioral engagement intentions. The brand type did not significantly influence participants’ perceptions of ad–media congruence. Moreover, the findings indicate individuals’ brand-self congruence and ad-self congruence were significant moderators in interactions with ad–media congruence in influencing consumers’ behavioral engagement intentions. Practical implications: Both brand managers and social media providers can leverage this study’s findings to improve ad effectiveness and consumer experiences in their respective social media landscapes. Specifically, knowing what kind of ad is more congruent and less intrusive, as well as how to better tailor targeting strategies in digital media spaces by building higher ad self- and brand self-congruence, can help them achieve persuasive effects when complying with the Federal Trade Commission disclosure guideline. Originality/value: The current study advances extant literature on native advertising by examining the core characteristic of ad–media congruence and its relation to the key metric of social media marketing success – consumer engagement intentions. The findings also extend the congruence theory by examining the interaction effect of media- and self-related congruence constructs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Contextual advertising; Online consumer behavior; Personalization; Social media advertising","","","","","","","","Aaker J.L., The malleable self: the role of self-expression in persuasion, Journal of Marketing Research, 36, 1, pp. 45-57, (1999); Banerjee S.S., Dholakia R.R., Mobile advertising: does location-based advertising work?, International Journal of Mobile Marketing, 3, 2, pp. 1-23, (2008); Barger V., Peltier J.W., Schultz D.E., Social media and consumer engagement: a review and research agenda, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 10, 4, pp. 268-287, (2016); Barger V.A., Labrecque L., An integrated marketing communications perspective on social media metrics, International Journal of Integrated Marketing Communications, 5, 1, pp. 64-76, (2013); Benton J., Like it or not, native advertising is squarely inside the big news tent, (2014); Brehm S.S., Brehm J.W., Psychological Reactance: A Theory of Freedom and Control, (2013); Brodie R.J., Ilic A., Juric B., Hollebeek L., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: an exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Calder B.J., Malthouse E.C., Schaedel U., An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 23, 4, pp. 321-331, (2009); Campbell C., Evans N.J., The role of a companion banner and sponsorship transparency in recognizing and evaluating article-style native advertising, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 43, 3, pp. 17-32, (2018); Casalo L.V., Flavian C., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Understanding consumer interaction on Instagram: the role of satisfaction, hedonism, and content characteristics, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 20, 6, pp. 369-375, (2017); Chang C., How mood and ad-self-congruency affect the relative influence of hedonic ad appeals and utilitarian ad appeals on product evaluations, Advances in Consumer Research, 31, 1, pp. 721-727, (2004); Chang C., Ad–self‐congruency effects: self‐enhancing cognitive and affective mechanisms, Psychology and Marketing, 22, 11, pp. 887-910, (2005); Chitturi R., Raghunathan R., Mahajan V., Delight by design: the role of hedonic versus utilitarian benefits, Journal of Marketing, 72, 3, pp. 48-63, (2008); Choi S.M., Rifon N.J., Antecedents and consequences of web advertising credibility: a study of consumer response to banner ads, Journal of Interactive Advertising, 3, 1, pp. 12-24, (2002); Chu S.-C., Viral advertising in social media: Participation in facebook groups and responses among college-aged users, Journal of Interactive Advertising, 12, 1, pp. 30-43, (2011); Coulter K.S., Sewall M.A., The effects of editorial context and cognitive and affective moderators on responses to embedded ads, ACR North American Advances, 22, 1, pp. 177-183, (1995); Coulter K.S., Gummerus J., Liljander V., Weman E., Pihlstrom M., Customer engagement in a facebook brand community, Management Research Review, 35, 9, pp. 857-877, (2012); Coursaris C.K., van Osch W., Balogh B.A., Do facebook likes lead to shares or sales?

While language has been a worthwhile area of study in the field of marketing, this article examines the linguistic feature of word elongation, the duplication of the same letter, as a strategy of marketing and enhancing customers’ engagement with the advertised products. The importance of this study emanates from the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study on word elongation as a strategy for marketing. In addition to scrutinizing the marketing function of this linguistic phenomenon in Palestine, we discuss the methods of translating word elongation in the light of Newmark’s theory of translation. The researchers have come to the conclusion that although communicative translation of ads is of great importance, the translator needs to take the additional semantic features of elongated words into consideration as they may have grammatical as well as social functions. © 2022 The Author(s).

These platforms play a key role in facilitating greater outreach and influence. This study proposes a mechanism for measuring the influencer index across popular social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. A set of features that determine the impact on the consumers are modelled using a regression approach. The underlying machine learning algorithms including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), K-NN Regression (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Lasso Regression models are adapted to compute a cumulative score in terms of influencer index. Findings indicate that engagement, outreach, sentiment, and growth play a key role in determining the influencers. Further, the ensemble of the four models resulted in the highest accuracy of 93.7% followed by the KNN regression with 93.6%. The study has implications across various domains of e-commerce, viral marketing, social media marketing and brand management wherein identification of key information propagators is essential. These influencer indices may further be utilized by e-commerce portals and brands for the purpose of social media promotion and engagement for larger outreach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Influencer; Internet marketing; Regression modelling; Social media analytics","algorithm; Internet; least squares method; machine learning; marketing; numerical model; regression analysis; social media; support vector machine","","","","","","","Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Algharabat R., Examining factors influencing Jordanian customers’ intentions and adoption of internet banking: Extending UTAUT2 with risk, J.

Evidence of understanding how HEIs can utilise student-generated social media data for higher education marketing and branding purposes is underexplored. This paper adopts a netnographic research method to illustrate how social media artefacts, such as the ‘This Is Where I Study’ (TIWIS) Facebook page, created by students in the form of dialogues and content can be analysed by HEIs to listen, engage further and influence students’ impressions. TIWIS illustrates that students’ engagement with social media platforms such as Facebook is dynamic in nature. It comprises behavioural expressions (manifestations and actions such as likes and shares as well as opinion comments) and individuals’ experiences (subjective in nature stories and comments of personal experiences and views). Hence, netnographic analysis allows capturing actual behaviours via longitudinal ‘big data’ sets and supports HEIs in proactive branding. Analysis of social media data demonstrates the value of encouraging and making accessible authentic conversations in order to create student-centred content. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Marketing of higher education;

To address this gap, we use various concepts such as efficiency, adaptability, risks of dependency, lack of quality control, asset-specificity and tacit knowledge to hypothesize the direct effect of technology sourcing on sales as well as the indirect effect through social media performance. Using survey data from 105 U.S. e-retailers, we show that e-retailers using mixed technology sourcing for website personalization have greater sales than e-retailers that use either internally or externally developed technology. On the contrary, e-retailers selecting externally developed technology for social media marketing have greater sales than e-retailers that offer social media marketing that uses either internally developed technology or mixed technology sourcing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Market performance; Social media marketing; Technology sourcing; Website personalization","","","","","","","","Aichner T., Jacob F., Measuring the degree of corporate social media use, International Journal of Market Research, 57, 2, pp. 257-275, (2015); Alfaro I., Watson-Manheim M.B., Social media: A technology that needs no support from IT… yet, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 55, 3, pp. 38-45, (2015); Allen T.J., Organizational structure, information technology, and R&D productivity, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 4, pp. 212-217, (1986); Anderson E.W., Fornell C., Lehmann D.R., Customer satisfaction, market share, and profitability: Findings from Sweden, The Journal of Marketing, 58, 3, pp. 53-66, (1994); Andzulis J.M., Panagopoulos N.G., Rapp A., A review of social media and implications for the sales process, Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management, 32, 3, pp. 305-316, (2012); Ayanso A., Yoogalingam R., Profiling retail web site functionalities and conversion rates: A cluster analysis, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 14, 1, pp. 79-113, (2009); Baruch Y., Holtom B.C., Survey response rate levels and trends in organizational research, Human Relations; Studies Towards the Integration of the Social Sciences, 61, 8, pp. 1139-1160, (2008); Bickart B., Schindler R.M., Internet forums as influential sources of consumer information, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 15, 3, pp. 31-40, (2001); Bodoff D., Ho S.Y., Effectiveness of website personalization: Does the presence of personalized recommendations cannibalize sampling of other items, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 20, 2, pp. 208-235, (2015); Bollen K.A., Structural equations with latent variables, (1989); Bollen K.A., Stine R., Direct and indirect effects: Classical and bootstrap estimates of variability, Sociological Methodology, 20, 1, pp. 15-140, (1990); Cai S., Xu Y., Designing not just for pleasure: Effect of web site aesthetics on consumer shopping value, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 4, pp. 159-188, (2011); Caloghirou Y., Kastelli I., Tsakanikas A., Internal capabilities and external knowledge sources: Complements or substitutes for innovative performance, Technovation, 24, 1, pp. 29-39, (2004); Chatterjee P., Interfirm alliances in online retailing, Journal of Business Research, 57, 7, pp. 714-723, (2002); Chintagunta P.K., Gopinath S., Venkataraman S., The effects of online user reviews on movie box office performance: Accounting for sequential rollout and aggregation across local markets, Marketing Science, 29, 5, pp. 944-957, (2010); Cho J., LoCascio B., An analysis of social media use in America's Fortune 500 companies, International Journal of the Academic Business World, 7, 1, pp. 67-76, (2013); Choeh J.Y., Lee H.J., Mobile push personalization and user experience, AI Communications, 21, 2-3, pp. 183-193, (2008); Choi J., Lee H.J., Kim Y.C., The influence of social presence on customer intention to reuse online recommender systems: The roles of personalization and product type, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 16, 1, pp. 129-153, (2011); Cohen J., Statistical power analysis for the social sciences, (1988); Cohen W., Levinthal D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 1, pp. 128-152, (1990); Cragg J.G., Donald S.G., Testing identifiability and specification in instrumental variable models, Econometric Theory, 9, pp. 222-240, (1993); Culnan M.J., McHugh P.J., Zubillaga J.I., How large US companies can use Twitter and other social media to gain business value, MIS Quarterly Executive, 9, 4, pp. 243-260, (2010); Du H., Jiang W., Do social media matter?

The success of global brands did not happen over time, and it seems that before social media there was always something precious that brand`s had – time. Time to communicate, time to create marketing campaigns, time to grow and evolve. Today, in the time of social media – there is everything but the time. Communication between consumers and brands is fast, global, and exposed for everyone to see and comment thanks to social media. Brands are more vulnerable than ever; consumers are in the position of power and now take an equal part in creating brands success. Brand management is changing, and marketing managers are faced with many challenges of navigating brands through social media. These challenges were the main idea behind the article. Explorative qualitative research was conducted by in-depth interviews of ten successful marketing managers in Croatia from various industries. From marketing agencies, food companies, the banking sector to the IT sector and direct TV sales, retail chain of sports shoes and equipment. In-depth interviews provided insight into their opinions based on experience in topics such as advantages and disadvantages of advertising on social media, measurement of advertising on social media, major challenges in brand management in a social networking environment; whether social networks and social media are synonymous or two different terms; what are the advantages and disadvantages of real-time consumer communication: and ultimately whether inßuencers are an indispensable variable in today’s advertising or just a passing trend. Results showed that for marketing managers in Croatia some of the advantages of social media are smart and targeted advertising, the fast possibility of reaction by brands, detailed analytics via Google and Facebook, relatively small Þnancial expenses compared to other media such as TV, and communication with consumers in real time. The disadvantages of social media are mostly that it is an extremely sensitive platform for communication with consumers due to the positive and negative consumer comments; potential long-term consumer saturation with advertising; certain errors in communication remain forever, etc. Authors of this paper hope that it will encourage further research and discussion by enabling much-needed insight into everyday challenges marketing managers face in Croatia, as well as globally while navigating the success of brands through the dynamic and challenging environment of social media. © 2021, Hrvatsko Drustvo Ekonomista.

This work projected a continuous attention-driven memory-based deep learning model to predict the credibility of an article. To exhibit the importance of continuous attention, research work is presented in accretive exaggeration mode. Initially, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model has been applied, which is extended by merging the concept of bidirectional LSTM for fake news identification. This research work proposed a continuous attention mechanism embedded (CAME)-bidirectional LSTM model for predicting the nature of news. Result shows the proposed CAME model outperforms the performance as compared to LSTM and the bidirectional LSTM model. Copyright © 2022, IGI Global.

It has been substantiated that the principal direction of digital marketing is the personalized attitude to users. It has been proven that the personalized relationship with a potential customer becomes the essence of marketing, the core of its effectiveness. It is shown that digital methods for processing and using information becoming the main source for improving marketing efficiency. The need for a comparative analysis of the technological innovations of digital marketing is predetermined by the fact that the scientific and technical development stimulates the emergence of a significant number of methods that have an influence on the consumer. Studying these methods makes it possible to identify their strengths when devising the marketing strategy and tactics of enterprises. The study highlighted a system of classical tools of digital marketing - search engine optimization, contextual advertising, social media marketing, technology of Big Data, retargeting, emailing. The essence, content, purpose, and scope of application of digital marketing tools were defined, which have emerged as a result of the latest technological innovations - native content, artificial intelligence, integration of marketing technologies, virtual and augmented reality, the Internet of Things, voice bots, voice, video and mobile marketing, affiliate marketing. Five strategies for the monetization of applications in mobile marketing have been identified. We have performed analysis of CPI-networks with a focus on mobile and non­motivated user traffic. We constructed a model of interaction between counterparties and the principles of an integrated approach to affiliate marketing projects, in particular, the need to find a reasonable, substantiated compromise plan has been shown. In this case, the task on choosing the optimal variant of a project is stated as a multicriteria optimization problem. We have analyzed methods for solving this problem and provide appropriate recommendations related to the choice of the most efficient method. The significance of the results obtained is predetermined by the fact that they could form a theoretical base for improving the effectiveness of marketing activity under conditions of the informatization of society through the use of appropriate strategies for monetization, better interaction between counterparties in affiliate marketing, identification of conditions for using the advantages and disadvantages of technological innovations of digital marketing. In contract to known methods for improving the effectiveness of marketing activity, the proposed approaches provide a basis for profitable work under conditions of digital economy. © M. Oklander, T. Oklander, O. Yashkina, I. Pedko, M. Chaikovska, 2018.; Розглянуто основнi технологiчнi iнновацiї цифрового мар- кетингу як специфiчної форми маркетингу в умовах iнформа- тизацiї суспiльства. Обґрунтовано, що головним напрямком цифрового маркетингу є персонiфiковане вiдношення до корис- тувачiв. Доведено, що персонiфiкований зв'язок з потенцiйним клiєнтом стає суттю маркетингу, першопричиною його ефек- тивностi. Показано, що цифровi методи обробки та викори- стання iнформацiї стають основним джерелом пiдвищення ефективностi маркетингу. Необхiднiсть порiвняльного аналiзу технологiчних iннова- цiй цифрового маркетингу обумовлена тим, що науково-тех- нiчний розвиток стимулює виникнення значної кiлькостi методiв впливу на споживача. Дослiдження цих методiв доз- воляє виявити їх сильнi сторони для використання при роз- робцi маркетингової стратегiї та тактики пiдприємств. В результатi дослiдження видiлена система класичних iнструментiв цифрового маркетингу - пошукова оптимiза- цiя, контекстна реклама, маркетинг в соцiальних мережах, технологiя великих даних, ретаргетiнг, електрона пошта. Визначено сутнiсть, змiст, призначення та область вико- ристання iнструментiв цифрового маркетингу, якi з'явили- ся в результатi новiтнiх технологiчних iнновацiй - натив- ний контент, штучний iнтелект, iнтеграцiя маркетингових технологiй, вiртуальна i доповнена реальнiсть, голосовi боти, Iнтернет речей, вiдео- i мобiльний маркетинг, парт- нерський маркетинг. Видiлено п'ять стратегiй монети- зацiї додаткiв в мобiльному маркетингу. Виконано аналiз CPI-мереж з орiєнтацiєю на мобiльний i невмотивований трафiк. Розроблено модель взаємодiї контрагентiв та прин- ципи iнтегрованого пiдходу проектiв партнерського мар- кетингу, зокрема показано необхiднiсть пошуку розумно- го, обґрунтованого компромiсного плану. При цьому задачу вибору оптимального варiанту проекту сформульовано як задачу багатокритерiальної оптимiзацiї. Проведено аналiз методiв вирiшення цiєї задачi та надано вiдповiднi рекомен- дацiї щодо вибору найбiльш доцiльного методу.

The focus on the digital segmentation of consumers has been subject to differing marketing orientations, beginning with relationship marketing and moving towards experiential marketing and now more recent efforts towards 'collaborative' marketing. The intention behind segmenting consumers is focused on more effectively engaging targeted segments towards repeat buying behaviours. However, as in past practices, the shift to social media marketing and social customer relationship management (social CRM) has been subject to some significant limitations. Although the advent of social media and the opening up of this space for marketing has created (the potential for) an expanded means for tracking and classifying consumer behaviour, this paper highlights the limitations of the practices for all but a few select marketing practices in the 'successful' 'making up' of markets. This paper examines the limitations in use of social media data. Despite the promises of big data, old ways of segmentation and classification die hard and are seen as and often are evaluated as (more) effective. While the potential for consumers to actively participate in forms of marketing has shifted with the advent of social media, studies of participation in multiple mediums for 'user' or consumer participation indicate that this is done infrequently. Social media remains 'uninstalled'. This paper highlights the limitations of specific marketing segmentations 'in practice.' It indicates that narratives of consumer empowerment and participation are limited alongside the slow and incremental adaptation to highly valued trends by most companies in practice. © GESIS.","Customer relationship management; Marketing technology; Segmentation; Social media","","","","","","","","Amoore L., Piotukh V., Life beyond big data: Governing with little analytics, Economy and Society, 44, 3, pp. 341-366, (2015); Araujo L., Markets, market-making and marketing, Marketing Theory, 7, 3, pp. 211-226, (2007); Arvidsson A., On the 'Pre-history of the panoptic sort': Mobility in market research, Surveillance & Society, 1, 4, pp. 456-474, (2004); Beckett A., Governing the consumer: Technologies of consumption, Consumption Markets & Culture, 15, 1, pp. 1-18, (2012); Birrer F.A.J., Data mining to combat terrorism and the roots of privacy concerns, Ethics and Information Technology, 7, 4, pp. 211-220, (2005); Bowker G.C., Star S.L., Sorting Things out: Classification and its Consequences, (2000); Burrell J., How the Machine 'Thinks': Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms, Big Data & Society, 3, 1, (2016); Burrows R., Gane N., Geodemographics, software and class, Sociology, 40, 5, pp. 793-812, (2006); Canhoto A.I., Clark M., Fennemore P., Emerging segmentation practices in the age of the social customer, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 21, 5, pp. 413-428, (2013); Carah N., Algorithmic brands: A decade of brand experiments with mobile and social media, New Media & Society, pp. 1-31, (2015); Danna A., Gandy O.H., All that glitters is not gold: Digging beneath the surface of data mining, Journal of Business Ethics, 40, 4, pp. 373-386, (2002); Dibb S., Market segmentation: Strategies for success, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 16, 7, pp. 394-406, (1998); Dibb S., Criteria guiding segmentation implementation: Reviewing the evidence, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 7, 2, pp. 107-129, (1999); Dibb S., Simkin L., Market segmentation: Diagnosing and treating the barriers, Industrial Marketing Management, 30, 8, pp. 609-625, (2001); Fassnacht M., The death of consumer segmentation?

Data were collected from 214 SMEs in Malaysia. Unlike extant literature, this study proposed a dual-stage analysis involving partial least squares (PLS) technique and artificial intelligence named deep artificial neural network (ANN). The application of deep ANN architecture is used to predict 91% of accuracy for the proposed model. The results showed that perceived relative advantage, perceived cost, top management support, perceived competitor pressure, and perceived vendor pressure have a significant impact on social media marketing adoption. Furthermore, the competitive industry moderates the effects of competitive pressure and customer pressure on social media marketing adoption. The results of the study extend the literature on social media marketing by illustrating the influence of technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) factors on social media marketing adoption among SMEs concerning the extent of industry competition. The results of the study enable policymakers and managers of SMEs to understand the factors that influence social media marketing adoption in both competitive and non-competitive industries and invest effectively in digital marketing. © The Author(s) 2022.","determinants;

Following that, we surveyed 1,329 Sub-Saharan African female Instagram users to investigate the mediating role of consumer satisfaction concerning the relationships between perceived usefulness, enjoyment and intentions to follow and recommend brands’ Instagram accounts and their invariance across three generations. We tested hypotheses using the Partial-Least-Squares Structural Equation Modelling and conducted emotion and sentiment analyses. We found that satisfaction fully translates the positivity of usefulness and enjoyments into higher intention to follow and recommend amongst the female Instagram users surveyed. Usefulness effects on satisfaction are more intense amongst Generation X. However, Generation Z developed a stronger intention to follow. Generations Y and Z are more likely to recommend than Generation X based on a positive experience. Satisfaction is a stronger transmitter of usefulness indirect effects onto following intentions amongst Generation X than its descendants who express intention to recommend due to indirect enjoyment effects conveyed via satisfaction. Finally, sentiment and emotion analyses of the users’ comments were reported using a natural language-processing method.

The content of the social advertisement is tailored in order to personalize the message to the target consumer groups. In an effort to reach the prospects, marketers should focus on the social leads on social networking sites (SNS) to promote and to sell their brands/products. Drawing on, online personalized advertising literature, e-WOM recommendations and increasing privacy concerns and perceived ad personalization (conceptualized as functions of psychological reactance) on SNS leads to avoid such advertisements. The goal of the study is to investigate the impact of perceived personalization, privacy concern, and e-WOM to consumers' behavioral click through intentions towards social ads. This study contributed to the theory of psychological reactance by indicating that the individuals with less privacy concern and personalized recommendations from their contacts on SNS have a smaller amount of reactance towards social advertisements than commercial advertisements by marketers. Suggestions for advertisers, social media marketing practitioners conclude the paper. © 2019, IGI Global.","Click On Intention; Perceived Personalization; Privacy Concern; Psychological Reactance; Recommendations; Social Advertising","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Stayman D.M., Vezina R., Identifying feelings elicited by advertising, Psychology and Marketing, 5, 1, pp. 1-16, (1988); Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Aguirre E., Mahr D., Grewal D., De Ruyter K., Wetzels M., Unraveling the personalization paradox: The effect of information collection and trust-building strategies on online advertisement effectiveness, Journal of Retailing, 91, 1, pp. 34-49, (2015); Akestam N., Rosengren S., Dahlen M., Advertising ""like a girl"": Toward a better understanding of ""femvertising"" and its effects, Psychology and Marketing, 34, 8, pp. 795-806, (2017); Anand B.N., Shachar R., Targeted advertising as a signal, QME, 7, 3, pp. 237-266, (2009); Aslay C., Bonchi F., Lakshmanan L.V., Lu W., Revenue maximization in incentivized social advertising, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, 10, 11, pp. 1238-1249, (2017); Baek T.H., Morimoto M., Stay away from me, Journal of Advertising, 41, 1, pp. 59-76, (2012); Bandyopadhyay S., Online privacy concerns of Indian consumers, The International Business & Economics Research Journal, 10, 2, (2011); Bang H., Wojdynski B.W., Tracking users' visual attention and responses to personalized advertising based on task cognitive demand, Computers in Human Behavior, 55, pp. 867-876, (2016); Bettman J.R., Luce M.F., Payne J.W., Constructive consumer choice processes, The Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 3, pp. 187-217, (1998); Bleier A., Eisenbeiss M., Personalized online advertising effectiveness: The interplay of what, when, and where, Marketing Science, 34, 5, pp. 669-688, (2015); Boateng H., Okoe A.F., Consumers' attitude towards social media advertising and their behavioural response: The moderating role of corporate reputation, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 9, 4, pp. 299-312, (2015); Brehm J.W., A Theory of Psychological Reactance, (1966); Brehm S.S., Oppositional behavior in children: A reactance theory approach, Developmental Social Psychology: Theory and Research, pp. 96-121, (1981); Brown J., Broderick A.J., Lee N., Word of mouth communication within online communities: Conceptualizing the online social network, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 21, 3, pp. 2-20, (2007); Brown J.J., Reingen P.H., Social ties and word-of-mouth referral behavior, The Journal of Consumer Research, 14, 3, pp. 350-362, (1987); Chen K., Shen H., Zhang H., Leveraging social networks for p2p content-based file sharing in disconnected manets, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 13, 2, pp. 235-249, (2014); Chen Q., Feng Y., Liu L., Ju J., Understanding Consumers' Reactance of Personalized Online Advertising Services: From a Perspective of Negative Effects, (2017); Cheung C.M., Lee M.K., What drives consumers to spread electronic word of mouth in online consumer-opinion platforms?, Decision Support Systems, 53, 1, pp. 218-225, (2012); Cheung M.Y., Luo C., Sia C.L., Chen H., Credibility of electronic word-of-mouth: Informational and normative determinants of on-line consumer recommendations, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 13, 4, pp. 9-38, (2009); Chu S.C., Kim Y., Determinants of consumer engagement in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites, International Journal of Advertising, 30, 1, pp. 47-75, (2011); Constantinides E., Romero C.L., Boria M.A.G., Social media: A new frontier for retailers?, European Retail Research, pp. 1-28, (2008); Costello A.B., Osborne J.W., Best practices in exploratory factor analysis: Four recommendations for getting the most from your analysis, Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation, 10, 7, pp. 1-9, (2005); Darpy D., Prim-Allaz I., Potential effects of psychological reactance and relationship proneness on relationships marketing programmes, 7th International Congress on Marketing Trends, (2009); De Keyzer F., Dens N., De Pelsmacker P., Is this for me?

Surveying the literature about publishers’ engagement with SM marketing (SMM), we argue that discourse modes of publishers’ SM practice, and the larger marketing ecologies of which this practice forms a part, have been transformed by contextual changes in the mediascape wherein publishing professionals are implicated through their sustained SMM activities. These changes include the rise of algorithmic filtering and paid-for content on Facebook and Twitter, industry’s embrace of data analytics, and the connection between them. The article explores the growing divide between small and large publishers in terms of their financial and cultural investment in data analytics, and concludes that the notion of SM as an equal-opportunity marketing tool in book publishing has proven demonstrably false because of this divide.

Context-based marketing uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) that recognise the physical environment of their users. Tourism marketers are increasingly becoming aware of those cutting-edge ICTs that provide tools to respond more accurately to the context within and around their users. This paper connects the different concepts of context-based marketing, social media and personalisation, as well as mobile devices. It proposes social context mobile (SoCoMo) marketing as a new framework that enables marketers to increase value for all stakeholders at the destination. Contextual information is increasingly relevant, as big data collected by a wide range of sensors in a smart destination provide real-time information that can influence the tourist experience. SoCoMo marketing introduces a new paradigm for travel and tourism. It enables tourism organisations and destinations to revolutionise their offering and to co-create products and services dynamically with their consumers. The proposed SoCoMo conceptual model explores the emerging opportunities and challenges for all stakeholders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Co-creation; Mobile context-awareness; Mobile technologies; Personalisation; Social media marketing","","","","","","","","Abowd G.D.K., Dey A.K., Towards a better understanding of context and context awareness, pp. 304-307, (1999); Ahlers D., Boll S., Wichmann D., Virtual signposts for location-based story-telling, (2008); Ayeh J.K., Leng D., Norman A., Law R., Perceptions and strategies of hospitality and tourism practitioners on social media: an exploratory study, Information and communication technologies in tourism, pp. 1-3, (2012); Balamurugan V., Mining user mobile behavior in location based services, International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications, 2, 9, pp. 1-3, (2012); Binkhorst E., Den Dekker T., Agenda for co-creation tourism experience research, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 18, 2-3, pp. 311-327, (2009); Beach A., Gartrell M., Xing X., Han R., Lv Q., Mishra S., Seada K., Fusing mobile, sensor, and social data to fully enable context-aware computing, pp. 60-65, (2010); Beldona S., Lin K., Yoo J., The roles of personal innovativeness and push vs pull delivery methods in travel-oriented location-based marketing services, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism, 3, 2, pp. 86-95, (2012); Bouwman H., Carlsson C., Lopez-Nicolas C., McKenna B., Molina-Castillo F., Tuunanen T., Walden P., Mobile travel services: the effect of moderating context factors, Information Technology and Tourism, 13, 2, pp. 57-74, (2012); Brake D.K., Safko L., The social media bible: tactics, tools, and strategies for business success, (2009); Buhalis D., eTourism: information technology for strategic tourism management, (2003); Buhalis D., Law R., Progress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the Internet - the state of eTourism research, Tourism Management, 29, pp. 609-623, (2008); Buhalis D., Amaranggana A., Smart tourism destinations, Information and communication technologies in tourism, 2014, pp. 553-564, (2014); Chan T.Y.T., Mobile customer relationship management: factors affecting consumer mobile technology adoption within the hotel industry, Studies by Undergraduate Researchers at Guelph, 5, 2, pp. 44-50, (2012); Choi H.-S., Park J.-W., Park S.-B., A study on the effect of mobile tourism information services on tourist satisfaction and continual reuse, International Journal for Business Information Technology, 1, 3, pp. 189-195, (2011); Costello S., Facebook revealed that is has experienced a year on year increase of 54% or 751 million mobile users every month., (2013); Dalmau M., Roose P., Laplace S., Context aware adaptable applications - a global approach, IJSCI International Journal of Computer Science, 1, pp. 13-25, (2009); Dhar S., Varshney U., Challenges and business models for mobile location-based services and advertising, Communications of the ACM, 54, 5, pp. 121-128, (2011); Dickinson J.E., Ghali K., Cherrett T., Speed C., Davies N., Norgate S., Tourism and the smart phone app: capabilities, emerging practice and scope for the travel domain, Current Issues in Tourism, 17, 1, pp. 84-101, (2012); SOLOMO (SOCIAL LOCAL MOBILE): a game changer for the travel industry?

Luxury brands use their social media accounts to post pictures of celebrities using their products. However, they would be confronted with the dilemma of whether to standardize or localize their celebrity endorsers for different markets. This dilemma of whether to standardize or adapt their advertisements to the local market has been haunting luxury brands for a long time. This paper examines the effectiveness of localized celebrity endorsements for luxury brands on Chinese social media. We analyze whether Chinese celebrity endorsers could trigger more social media interactions and enhance perceived brand luxury than Western celebrity endorsers, based on an analysis of online big data and two experiments. We also explore when localized celebrity endorsement is most effective, focusing on the moderating role of patriotism. The results suggest that localized (vs. standardized) celebrity endorsements lead to more social media interactions. Using localized (standardized) celebrity endorsements enhance the perceived brand luxury for people with high (low) patriotism. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Celebrity endorsement; Luxury brands; Patriotism; Perceived brand luxury; Social media","China; advertising; marketing; social media","","","","","","","Arora A., Bansal S., Kandpal C., Aswani R., Dwivedi Y., Measuring social media influencer index- insights from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, J.

The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. A recent knowledge-based technology in this context is sentic computing, which relies on the ensemble application of common-sense computing and the psychology of emotions to infer the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language. Sentic computing, however, is limited by the richness of the knowledge base and by the fact that the bag-of-concepts model, despite more sophisticated than bag-of-words, misses out important discourse structure information that is key for properly detecting the polarity conveyed by natural language opinions. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm to concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept within the sentence and, hence, obtain a polarity detection engine that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In September 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched an anti-vaping campaign, in U.S. high schools, on social media and other platforms, emphasizing ""The Real Cost""of e-cigarettes. Using a novel deep learning approach, we assessed changes in vaping-related content on Instagram from 2017 to 2019 and drew an inference about the initial impact of the FDA's Real Cost campaign on Instagram. We collected 245,894 Instagram posts that used vaping-related hashtags (e.g., #vape, #ejuice) in four samples from 2017 to 2019. We compared the ""like""count from these posts before and after the FDA campaign. We used deep learning image classification to analyze 49,655 Instagram image posts, separating images of men, women, and vaping devices. We also conducted text analysis and topic modeling to detect the common words and themes in the posted captions. Since September 2018, the FDA-sponsored hashtag #TheRealCost has been used about 50 times per month on Instagram, whereas vaping-related hashtags we tracked were used up to 10,000 times more often. Comparing the pre-intervention (2017, 2018) and post-intervention (2019) samples of vaping-related Instagram posts, we found a three-fold increase in the median ""like""count (10 vs. 28) and a 6-fold increase in the proportion of posts with more than 100 likes (2 vs. 15%). Over 70% of Instagram vaping images featured e-juices and devices, with a growing number of images depicting a ""pod,""the type of discrete vaping device that delivers high concentration of nicotine and is favored by novice e-cigarette users. In addition, the Instagram analytics data shared by the vaping influencers we interviewed showed underage Instagram users among their followers. © Vassey, Metayer, Kennedy and Whitehead.","deep learning; e-cigarettes; images; instagram; social media; vape; vaping","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P50ES018172); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, (RD83615901); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; University of California Berkeley, UCB","This study was conducted in collaboration and with funding provided by the UC Berkeley Center for Integrative Research on Childhood Leukemia and the Environment (CIRCLE).

First — and even in the absence of key performance indicators — it improves marketing efficiency, as life-cycle marketing, automated price adjustment and programmatic advertising based on artificial intelligence (AI) all support the vision of fully standardised marketing automation, with real-time, optimised customer centricity. Secondly, new marketing areas such as viral marketing, social media marketing and content marketing emphasise the increasing significance of creative marketing. Looking for paradigmatic principles reveals that performance marketing is shaped by analytic, processual and lean thinking. In contrast, creative marketing depends on agile outside-in thinking as a key element in the debate regarding marketing 3.0. Thus, digitisation seems to foster paradigmatic incompatibilities within marketing 4.0. This paper argues that until Big Data and AI can judge creativity, the digitisation of marketing will continue to suffer teething problems. © Henry Stewart Publications 2050-0076 (2021).","Creativity; Marketing 3.0; Marketing 4.0; Marketing intelligence; Paradigm; Performance marketing","","","","","","","","Kotler P., Kartajaya H., Setiawan I., Marketing 4.0: Moving from Traditional to Digital, (2017); Achrol R.S., Kotler P., Frontiers of the marketing paradigm in the third millennium, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 40, 1, pp. 35-52, (2012); Kuhn T.S., The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, (1962); Lies J., Marketing intelligence and big data: Digital marketing techniques on their way to becoming social engineering techniques, International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence, 5, 5, pp. 134-144, (2019); Chen H., Chiang R.H.L., Storey V., Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact, MIS Quarterly, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012); Kannan P.K., Li A., Digital marketing: A framework, review and research agenda, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 34, 1, pp. 22-45, (2017); Wood C., Marketing automation: Lessons learnt so far, Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice, 16, 4, pp. 251-254, (2015); Biegel B., The current view and outlook for the future of marketing automation, Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice, 10, 3, pp. 201-213, (2009); Heimbach I., Kostyra D.

In particular, applying the dual perspective of customer engagement, this research examines the influence of focusing on the entertainment, interaction, trendiness, and customization dimensions of a luxury brand's social media activities on customer engagement with brand-related social media content. Using big data retrieved from a 60-month period on Twitter (July 2012 to June 2017), this paper analyzes 3.78 million tweets from the top 15 luxury brands with the highest number of Twitter followers. The results indicate that focusing on the entertainment, interaction, and trendiness dimensions of a luxury brand's social media marketing efforts significantly increases customer engagement, while focusing on the customization dimension does not. The findings have important implications for the design, delivery, and management of social media marketing for luxury brands to engage customers with social media content. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Customer engagement; Luxury brand; Social media; Twitter","","","","","","","","Algesheimer R., Dholakia U.M., Herrmann A., The social influence of brand community: Evidence from European car clubs, Journal of Marketing, 69, 3, pp. 19-34, (2005); Allison P.D., Fixed effects regression models, 160, (2009); Araujo T., Neijens P., Vliegenthart R., What motivates consumers to re-tweet brand content?, Journal of Advertising Research, 55, 3, pp. 284-295, (2015); Barger V., Peltier J.W., Schultz D.E., Social media and consumer engagement: A review and research agenda, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 10, 4, pp. 268-287, (2016); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Bird S., Klein E., Loper E., Natural language processing with Python, (2009); Brodie R.J., Ilic A., Juric B., Hollebeek L., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Butler T.D., Armstrong C., Ellinger A., Franke G., Employer trustworthiness, worker pride, and camaraderie as a source of competitive advantage: Evidence from great places to work, Journal of Strategy and Management, 9, 3, pp. 322-343, (2016); Cailleux H., Mignot C., Kapferer J.N., Is CRM for luxury brands?, Journal of Brand Management, 16, 5-6, pp. 406-412, (2009); Cameron A.C., Trivedi P.K., Microeconometrics using Stata, 2, (2010); Campesato O., Regular expressions: Pocket primer, (2018); Chen H., Wang Y., Connecting or disconnecting: Luxury branding on social media and affluent Chinese female consumers' interpretations, Journal of Brand Management, 24, 6, pp. 562-574, (2017); Choi E., Ko E., Kim A.J., Explaining and predicting purchase intentions following luxury-fashion brand value co-creation encounters, Journal of Business Research, 69, 12, pp. 5827-5832, (2016); Christodoulides G., Michaelidou N., Li C.H., Measuring perceived brand luxury: An evaluation of the BLI scale, Journal of Brand Management, 16, 5-6, pp. 395-405, (2009); Chu S.C., Kim Y., Determinants of consumer engagement in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites, International Journal of Advertising, 30, 1, pp. 47-75, (2011); Colditz J.B., Chu K.-H., Emery S.L., Larkin C.R., James A.E., Welling J., Primack B.A., Toward real-time infoveillance of Twitter health messages, American Journal of Public Health, 108, 8, pp. 1009-1014, (2018); Dauriz L., Remy N., Sandri N., Luxury shopping in the digital age, Perspectives on retail and consumers goods, pp. 26-31, (2014); De Vries L., Gensler S., Leeflang P.S., Popularity of brand posts on brand fan pages: An investigation of the effects of social media marketing, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 26, 2, pp. 83-91, (2012); Dearden K., Crookston B., Madanat H., West J., Penny M., Cueto S., What difference can fathers make?

The perceptions of social media users are assessed based on the 7P marketing mix, namely: (i) product, (ii) promotion and education, (iii) price and other user outlays, (iv) process, (v) people, (vi) physical environment, and (vii) time. Design/methodology/approach: The research approach is descriptive quantitative, calculating the frequency of tweets based on their 7P marketing category and then interpreting the results. We collected more than 500,000 tweets by Twitter users in Indonesia, containing the phrase 'Islamic bank' between 2007 to 2018. The data was analysed using R software and managed using R-Python software. Findings: Results indicate that the 'people' factor gained the most responses from social media users, who were mainly customers of the Islamic banks, obtaining both positive and negative sentiments. The highest positive response given by customers were comments on staff's attitude, good appearance and courteous customer service, while they disliked long queues and convoluted service. These findings provide important insight for effective marketing strategies of Islamic banks. Originality/Value: This research is the first research in the world revealing the perception of consumers of Islamic banks through Twitter. It is also the first to reveal perceptions of Islamic banks through Twitter, using the 7Ps Marketing Mix analysis tool. This research was conducted using big data analysis (i.e. it used more than 500,000 Twitter tweets) analyse Islamic bank consumers. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","7Ps; Indonesia; Islamic bank; Marketing mix; R-Python; Twitter","","","","","","","","Ahmad S.Z., Ahmad N., Bakar A.R.A., Reflections of Entrepreneurs of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Concerning the Adoption of Social Media and Its Impact on Performance Outcomes: Evidence from the Uae, Telematics and Informatic, (2017); Akgun A.E., Standardization and Adaptation of International Marketing Mix Activities: A Case Study, Turkey: Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 15, pp. 609-618, (2014); Chang H.-L., Chou Y.-C., Wu D.-Y., Wu S.-C., Will Firm's Marketing Efforts on Owned Social Media Payoff?

We propose a causal model to find out which expected capabilities of the future AI-based software can explain potential users’ intention to test and use this innovative technological solution for SMM, based on integer valued regression models. With this purpose, R software is used to analyze the data provided by the respondents. We identify different causal configurations of upcoming capabilities of the AI-based software, classified in three categories (audience, image and sentiment analysis), and will trigger potential users’ intention to test and use the software, based on an fsQCA approach. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Audience analysis; Image analysis; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social media marketing","France; Italy; Romania; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Image analysis; Learning systems; Marketing; Regression analysis; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Audience analysis; Causal model; Potential users; R softwares; Regression model; Social media marketings; Technological solution; Three categories; artificial intelligence; image analysis; marketing; social media; software; Software testing","","","","","CCCDI; European Foundation of Management Development; Romanian Ministry of Research; Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation; University of Galati?; Southeastern Transportation Research, Innovation, Development and Education Center, STRIDE Center; Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, MRIS; Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI, (PN-III-P1-1.2-PCCDI-2017-0800/86PCCDI/2018); Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI; Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne; National Center for Research and Development, NCRD, (14PFE/17.10.2018); National Center for Research and Development, NCRD; performance and competitiveness in the Research, Development and Innovation","Funding text 1: This research was conducted within the framework of the project FutureWeb, launched by Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation , CCCDI – UEFISCDI , project number PN-III-P1-1.2-PCCDI-2017-0800/86PCCDI/2018 , within PNCDI III.

Deceptive comments harm users’ trust in online social media and cause financial loss to firms. Previous studies use various features and classification algorithms to detect and filter social spam on several social media platforms. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not exploited both probabilistic topic modeling and incremental learning to detect social spam on SMSs. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is design of a novel detection methodology that combines topic- and user-based features to improve the effectiveness of social spam detection. The proposed methodology exploits a probabilistic generative model, namely the labeled latent Dirichlet allocation (L-LDA), for mining the latent semantics from user-generated comments, and an incremental learning approach for tackling the changing feature space. An experiment based on a large dataset extracted from YouTube demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, which achieves an average accuracy of 91.17 % in social spam detection. Our statistical analysis reveals that topic-based features significantly improve social spam detection, which has significant implications for business practice. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Big data; Incremental learning; Machine learning; Social spam; Spam detection; Topic modeling","Big data; Data mining; Feature extraction; Filtration; Learning systems; Losses; Semantics; Statistics; User profile; Incremental learning; Latent semantics; Online social medias; Social media; Social media marketings; Social spam; Social webs; Spam detection; Topic Modeling; User-generated; Social networking (online)","","","","","Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology R&D Funding - Basic Research Program, (JCYJ20140419115614350); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (CityU 11502115)","This work was supported by grants from the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Projects: CityU 11502115), and the Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology R&D Funding - Basic Research Program (Project No. JCYJ20140419115614350).

To this end, this study developed a multi-phased social media analytic framework (data crawling, data processing and text mining, social network analysis, semantic network analysis, and network visualization) to assess the structure of information exchanges between the members of a tourism organization’s social network community and identified influential actors and information content within the social network. This study’s findings suggest genuine ways of relating with and utilizing opinion leaders and influencers in social media marketing communication as well as crisis communication.

Using the examples of telematics data in car insurance, efforts by health insurers to incentivize health behaviours (for example through the use of fitness trackers), and insurance companies’ own marketing materials, we assess the current state of play in the field of ‘personalized’ insurance pricing, pointing to obstacles as well as opportunities associated with its development. We then set these contemporary developments against a longer history of insurance pricing, understood as a history of arranging and classifying objects and persons for the purposes of calculating risk. We show that in its longer history, insurance reflected but also contributed to uncertainties about the distinction between persons and property. Drawing these two strands together, we conclude by assessing the implications of insurtech for future understandings of personhood. While there is scope for new categories of personhood to emerge, we show that there are also important continuities between past and present in terms of the challenge of bringing persons, parts of persons, material objects and pecuniary interests into successful alignment. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","data;

Design/methodology/approach: A survey technique was employed whereby primary and secondary data was collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Participants involved business operators or employees of start-up businesses and SMEs in the Saudi Arabian context. Data were analyzed by using partial least square-structure equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: AISMM, which exhibits an increasing trend among start-up businesses and SMEs in Saudi Arabia, accounts for an overall increase in the number of customers and customer bases—and an additional tertiary effect of increased profitability. AISMM increases the effective business management and SMEs performance (SMEP). Moreover, effective business management increases the SMEP Originality/value: This study is quite unique as it is investigated that AISMM practices has significant role to enhance SMEP in which effective business management playing a mediating role. Implications: The practitioners can get help from this study to increase the performance by decreasing various problems of marketing by using AISMM. © 2020 The Authors.

So far, little attention has been paid in developing countries to the most rapidly growing type of advertising and the present study aims to contribute to fill this research gap. A survey study was carried out to understand the attitudes using Ducoffe's advertising value model and extending it by the inclusion of ""rewards"" and ""personalization"" constructs. Facebook ads are used as a proxy for social media ads and a total of 327 questionnaires were collected from Turkish consumers, which were filtered down to 281 and analyzed using structural equation modelling. The findings indicate that credibility, personalization, informativeness and entertainment have direct positive effects on advertising value and have indirect effects on attitudes towards social media ads. Personalization emerged as a significant factor affecting all other related constructs. © Copyright 2018, IGI Global.","Digital Advertising; Facebook Ads; Social Media Ads; Social Media Marketing; Social Networking Sites","","","","","","","","Agrifoglio R., Black S., Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Motivation in Continued Twitter Usage, Journal of Computer IS, 53, 1, pp. 33-41, (2012); Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Dwivedi Y.K., Algharabat R., Social media in marketing: A review and analysis of the existing literature, Telematics and Informatics, (2017); Altuna O.K., Konuk F.A., Understanding Consumer Attitudes Toward Mobile Advertising and its Impact on Consumers' Behavioral Intention: A ross-market comparison of U.S. and Turkish Consumers, International Journal of Mobile Marketing, 4, 2, pp. 43-51, (2009); Barutcu S., Attitudes Towards Mobile Marketing Tools: A study of Turkish Consumers, Journal of Targeting.

Twitter is one of the leading social media microblogging platforms, where users can post and interact. #Hashtags specify the tweeter trends on a certain topic. Currently, the hashtag value or trend ranking for a particular hashtag has been calculated based on the cumulative number of tweets. This type of cumulative amount of hashtag ranking may result in an anonymous intervention of irrelevant tweets, which affects social media marketing. The proposed approach uses the relevance of tweets and #hashtags to improve and identify the suspicious or irrelevant tweets of media marketing.

In the situation with the new data source, new technological means for harvesting and processing of data, digitalisation and fourth economic revolution is very relevant not only for the operation but the marketing function as well. Social media represent an excellent source of data and channel of communication with the customer. Marketing spending on digital media platform soon will be no. 1, and it will overtake TV as the dominant marketing channel. Introducing the big data analytical capabilities, adjustment of overall organisation scheme and hiring competent personnel, the company will be in a position to save money for marketing spending, but in same time overall marketing performances will increase.

To counter the negative impact of social media marketing, some firms have begun hiring people to generate fake reviews which either promote their own products or damage their competitor’s reputation. This study proposes a framework, which takes advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, for the observation of behaviors among spammers. Then, based on the behavior of participants on web forums, the authors build up a post-reply network. The main focus is on the behavior-related features of the reviews, their propagation, and their popularity. The primary objective of this study is to build an effective online spammer detection model and the method detailed in this work can be used to improve the performance of spammer detection models. An experiment is carried out with a real dataset, the results of which indicate that these new features are important for identifying spammers. Finally, random walk clustering is applied to investigate the post-reply network. Some interesting and important features are observed in the interactions between a group of spammers which could be subjected to further research. © 2021 IGI Global.

Research suggests that social media posts should be vivid, practical, interesting, personalized, and interactive. However, cross-cultural research also suggests that practices might not be equally effective across different regional markets. While vividness and practicality could be consistently important across cultures, characteristics of interest, personalization, and interactivity might need to be adapted to the cultural conditions of specific target markets. We consider how individualism/collectivism, long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and high-context/low-context cultures could influence brand post effectiveness. We provide suggestions for how to manage social media brand post popularity from a cross-cultural perspective to inform both domestic and global social media marketing campaigns. Suggested practices include: (1) making brand posts engaging; (2) targeting the ‘I’ in individualistic cultures and the ‘we’ in collectivist cultures; (3) focusing on consumers’ identity in less long-term oriented cultures and on functional information in more long-term oriented cultures; (4) ensuring that posts help reduce uncertainty; (5) planning for one-way communication in higher power distance countries and two-way communication in lower power distance countries; and (6) making messages less direct in higher-context cultures and more direct in lower-context cultures. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Brand social media; Cross cultural marketing; Global marketing strategy; Social media strategy; Word of mouth","","","","","","","","Acar A., Culture and social media: An elementary textbook, (2014); Agourram H., (2013); Beukeboom C.J., Kerkhof P., de Vries M., Does a virtual like cause actual liking?

An original database consisting of multiple candidates of casual English phonemes was constructed, and linguistic analysis of Twitter data used to establish the optimum frequency of slang tokens per sentence. The human-likeness and legibility of output sentences of the experimental system were evaluated using an experiment based on the classical definition of the Turing test, in which fifty human evaluators attempted to distinguish sentences produced by the system from genuine humanauthored sentences. The experiment results demonstrated that the gap in human-likeness scores between the ""human"" and ""machine"" sentences was small, and that some ""machine"" sentences actually outperformed several of the ""human sentences."" The ""machine"" sentences' average score of 3.1 on a 5-point scale, where 3 indicated complete uncertainty of whether the sentences were human-authored or machine-authored, can be considered a pass of the Turing test in the established definition. In this paper, we describe the potential approaches to the task, the construction of the phonetic database and the proposed system, and discuss the evaluation results.
